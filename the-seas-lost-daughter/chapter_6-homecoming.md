Narrator: You sigh, feeling a headache coming on from what a mess things turned out to be.  
Layla(sad): Yeah, okay. Everything turned out okay in the end. I'm fine. No one died.

Maddie(happy): Yes! I'm so excited. We bought supplies at the store the other day and never got to use them!  
Layla(surprise): Supplies? For what?  
Narrator: Maddie dashes to the kitchen and pulls out a bag of giant marshmallows and a box of cereal.  
Narrator: At the sight of them, you, Sam, and Maddie all shout in unison.  
Narrator*Top: Sam, Maddie, and YOU | CHEWY! CRISPY! CRACKLE! CRUNCH!

Addison(smile): Don't you remember those old commercials?  
Shaun(surprise): No...?  
Narrator: Maddie snatches up a spoon nearby and waves it around like it's a wand.  
Maddie(happy): Come, mallow minions! This kid is in danger of a severe lack of snacks!  
Shaun(surprise): Oh my god.  
Narrator: You and Sam stand on either side of her, waving your fingers as if casting a spell.  
Layla(happy): Say the magic words!  
Shaun(surprise): Uh...  
Addison(smile): Chewy, crispy, crackle, crunch?  
Sam(happy): You got it.  
Maddie(smile): Normally this is where Captain Mallowmarsh would wave his wand and treats would appear...  
Maddie: We actually have to make ours, though.  
Narrator: She shakes the box of cereal.

Narrator: As he does so, the rest of you take turns tossing in large, soft marshmallows.  
Shaun(surprised): This gets... Pretty hard to stir... Don't it?  
Layla(happy): Why do you think we left it up to you?  
Narrator: You toss another marshmallow in. Addison follows suit, concentrating on the task much more than is necessary.
