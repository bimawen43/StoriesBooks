Narrator: Alan tricks two opposing players with a swift fake move, bumps into the player who tried to stop him, and...  
Narrator: ...carries the ball into the try line!  
Narrator: Soon, the first session ends. Both sides return to the adjustment zone.  
Danielle(happy): Eight versus two! Well done, Alan!  
Mavis(smile): ...Don't celebrate too soon. The game is just beginning.  
Narrator: The opposing team changes its formation under their coach's guidance. After the kick-off, they send Seth to intercept Alan.  
Danielle(surprise): Oh God, Alan, run!  
Narrator: You stand up involuntarily and shout just like everyone around you.  
Narrator: Although Alan passes the ball to his teammate in time, he's pushed to the ground with his arm pressed under his body.  
Narrator: You looked nervously at the people who fell, your heart thumping in your chest.  
\>  
Narrator: When Alan stands up, he keeps on running, but his left arm is just hanging there, barely moving.  
Danielle*Think(sad): His wounds must have gotten worse...  
Narrator: The whole second session has ended, Alan walks to the courtside with a grimace.  
Danielle*Think(surprise): I should...

## B. Sit on the bleachers and wait.  
#### A  
Narrator: As soon as Alan comes to the side, you jump down off the bleachers and run toward him.  
Narrator: You gently touch Alan's shoulders, looking at his wounds nervously.  
\*Condition  
### ## A. (Condition: SEX_UNIFORM >= 1)  
### ## B. (Condition: SEX_UNIFORM < 1)  
#### A  
Alan(smile): Wow. If I can have the favor of a sexy goddess every time I get hurt, I'm willing to fall a few more times.  
Danielle(smile): Relax. I'm not here to joke with you.  
Alan(smile): This is not a joke. You know... you are usually beautiful, but...  
\*Alan LOVE +1  
Alan(smile): You look a little different today. You have an unforgettable vigor and beauty.  
Danielle*Think(shy): Oh my God. His stare made me almost forget why I'm here.  
#### B  
Alan(smile): I hope you're just here to comfort me.  
Danielle(smile): Relax. I'm not here to ask you to give up.  
\***  
\***  
Danielle(sad): I just want to know if the bump just now hurt you. Are you feeling okay?  
Alan(sad): I'm in a little pain...  
Danielle: Only a little?  
\>>  
Alan: Alright, a lot of pain.  
Alan(happy): But I don't think there will be a problem. One arm is enough to get me to the podium.  
Narrator: You and Alan stare at each other, neither giving way to the other.  
Danielle(smile): Okay. I won't talk you out of it.  
Narrator: You stand on your tiptoes and hug him.  
Danielle: This is the best I can do for you...  
\*Alan LOVE +1  
Alan(smile): That's very helpful.  
Narrator: Alan gives you a hug and runs over to his coach.  
Narrator: When you return to the bleachers, you see Alan arguing with his coach. Eventually, the coach shrugs and sighs, and Alan smiles.  
Mavis(happy): Wow.  
Narrator: You hear Mavis' exaggerated, deliberate exclamation. You turn around and see her with her chin in her hands, looking at you expectantly.  
Mavis(smile): That was a very exciting hug.  
\>  
Mavis(happy): You seem like a loyal fan of Alan.  
Danielle(shy): I was just worried.  
Mavis(smile): Have a little faith. He's Alan. Although I am a Seth fan today, but Alan is always the brightest star.  
#### B  
Narrator: You are constantly fidgeting in your seat until the half-time break is over...  
Danielle*Think(smile): I regret it... Maybe I should have gone down just now...  
\***  
Narrator: The second half of the game is very intense. Alan's team takes the lead by a very small margin.  
Narrator: As the game gets closer and closer to the end, Alan carries the ball...  
Narrator: But as Alan carries the ball forward, the opposing player tackles him down!  
\>>>  
Danielle(surprise): Oh no!  
\>  
Narrator: At the very last moment, before Alan falls to the ground, he throws the ball to his teammate...  
Danielle: I should...  
# (ws_08n_08_end_game)  
## A. Cheer for the team!  
## B. Cover your eyes nervously.  
#### A  
Narrator: The teammate takes the ball from Alan, but it's soon intercepted.  
Narrator: You stand up, clenching your fists so tight that your nails bite into your palms. You cry out.  
Danielle(happy): Go Alan! You can do it!  
Narrator: Following after you, Alan's supporters shout out Alan's name, cheering him up.  
Narrator: Soon, Alan struggles up and pushes aside the crowd of players around him.  
Narrator: The teammate throws the ball back -- and Alan carries the ball and charges into the end zone!  
Narrator: The entire audience leaps to their feet and cheers excitedly. Alan and his teammates take off their helmets, hugging each other.  
#### B  
Narrator: You close your eyes nervously, your heart thumping in your chest.  
Narrator: You don't know how long it's been -- maybe a long time, maybe just a moment--before you hear cheering.  
Narrator: You open your eyes and see Alan sitting in the end zone with the ball in his hands and a big smile on his face.  
Mavis(happy): Don't just stand there. Alan won!  
\***  
Narrator: Mavis hurries you down the bleachers.  
Narrator: She screams and hugs Alan, and then she goes to comfort her new target Seth.  
Mavis(happy): You are incredible. Even compared to Alan, your performance is not inferior at all.  
Benjamin(happy): Mavis, keep your voice down. His teammates are all watching you.  
Mavis(happy): I don't care. Let's go and celebrate. All of you need to go. It'll be my treat.  
Narrator: Mavis turns around, blocking the crowd's sight, and mouths for you to help.  
Danielle(happy): Yes, I think we could use some hamburgers and cold drinks. Mavis will treat us, now or never.  
Narrator: Alan smiles at Mavis teasingly, but then he shrugs.  
Alan(smile): {Danielle Name} is right. Let's go, all of us.  
Narrator: Mavis nods, satisfied, and pulls you ahead of the crowd. Rugby players follow, laughing and commenting on the performance of the players.  
Narrator: The merriment continues until everyone is seated at Old Ross's.

Danielle: Cool down a bit, my friend.  
Mavis(happy): Look at this! How can I cool down?  
Narrator: Mavis holds up the rugby ball beside Alan, pointing to the black handwritten "Alan" on it.  
Mavis(happy): This is a symbol of our brave athletes, a group of fierce stallions.  
Narrator: You take the rugby ball and touch the handwriting. There are some smudges on the handwriting.  
Danielle*Think(happy): Maybe sweat has fallen on it where he signed it.  
Danielle(happy): Okay, maybe we all deserve some cheering up.  
Danielle(sad): Alan, how are you doing with your wounds?  
Alan(happy): I think I'm fine.  
Narrator: Alan takes the ball and writes the words, "to {Danielle Name}", right after "Alan."  
Danielle(surprise): What?  
Alan(happy): Thank you for wrapping my wounds. This win is all because of you. Just take it as a souvenir.

Danielle(sad): I really wish we were adults right now, so we could drink beer instead of soda.  
Danielle(happy): But it doesn't matter. Let's have a toast.  
Narrator: You clink the bubbling glasses together. Cold soda splatters on your hands.  
Danielle(happy): Congratulations, Alan. With your grades and your rugby, you'll go to Harvard.  
Alan(happy): Hopefully so.  
Alan(smile): And now it's time to party. We just need to relax and enjoy ourselves.
