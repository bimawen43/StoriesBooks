Narrator: As soon as you step into the Forbidden Forest, you realize the ground is damp beneath your feet. Tall, wet grass sticks to your legs.  
Danielle(sad): This is a little nasty.  
Joe(smile): Just hang in there.  
Narrator: Ben takes out the map, searching it with uncertainty.  
Benjamin: Right now, we're here...  
Narrator: The forest is almost completely dark. Even the moonlight is blocked by the canopy of leaves.  
Narrator: The air is thick with the smell of pine and rot.  
Narrator: Beneath your feet, you feel soft, decaying leaves. Insects buzz in your ear. The sound of water echoes from somewhere unseen.  
Narrator: The three of you begin to bunch closer and closer together.  
Benjamin(smile): I gotta say, this forest is like a green tomb.

Narrator: You fasten your pace, leaving Joe and Benjamin behind. You examine the ground carefully as you walk.  
Joe(surprise): {Danielle Name}, wait! Look here!  
Narrator: Joe points to the ground a few steps from you. You walk forward and find the soil wet and loosened. Someone has been shoveling the mud.  
Narrator: You walk further and see that the grass has been trampled down.  
Danielle(surprise): I think this is the crime scene!  
Narrator: Following the traces, you dash ahead.

Danielle(angry): It's gone!  
Joe: Well, let's look around for any clues.  
Danielle: Should we split up and look? See if we can find anything weird?  
Joe: Sure. But don't go too far. And watch out for wild animals.  
Danielle: Don't worry. I don't want to become anybody's snack. I'll be careful.

Narrator: You look back and see Benjamin jump out of the bushes.  
Benjamin(happy): It's me! I was trying to ambush the monster, but I didn't know you would show up.  
Benjamin(happy): So I decided to play a trick on you. How was it? Did you like it?  
Danielle(angry): I'm sure the monster would appreciate your tricks more than me.  
Benjamin(smile): Sorry, I was just... Hey, don't be mad.  
Danielle(smile): I'm not mad. But Ben, it's not a good time for pranks.

Danielle(sad): NOOOO!  
Narrator: You look at the shadowy figure, horrified. Benjamin cries out and lunges at the monster!

Narrator: You hear voices coming from the bushes ahead. You walk forward and see Joe and Benjamin struggling to stand.

Danielle(smile): I'm fine... We're lucky to have escaped.

Joe(smile): This isn't the most useful weapon, but it's better than nothing.

Narrator: You raise your hand and slap the monster's face away.  
Joe(angry): Damn it! This gun is useless!

Alan(smile): Because I was worried about you.  
Danielle(surprise): But how did you know we were in the Forbidden Forest?  
Narrator: All of you stare at Alan. He smiles awkwardly and changes the subject.  
Alan(smile): Hey, guys! I don't think this is a good time to talk.

Alan: Let's keep walking and stay together. Don't leave anyone behind.

Narrator: You look around, listening carefully. But all you can hear is the wind blowing through the leaves and the grass.  
Danielle(smile): Looks like the monster is really gone.  
Narrator: Benjamin takes out the map, trying to identify the marks under the dim moonlight.  
Benjamin(happy): I think I know where we are now.  
Danielle(surprise): Are you sure? We ran so fast just now.  
Benjamin(happy): Of course! I'm Benjamin, the one who never gets lost!  
Narrator: Benjamin leads the way with confidence. You and Joe support each other and follow him. Alan walks behind you.  
Narrator: After a few minutes, Benjamin takes the map out and studies it closely.  
Benjamin(sad): Uh, guys, there's something I need to tell you...  
Narrator: You look at him, confused. Benjamin turns away, trying to avoid your eyes. He scratches his head, embarrassed.

Benjamin(sad): I'm sorry... It's just too complicated...

Danielle(surprise): ... A cabin?  
Benjamin(surprise): How can it be... Really? A cabin?  
Narrator: Under the moonlight, the walls of the little cabin are strewn with decaying cracks. The whole cabin is wrapped in weeds and vines.  
Narrator: The glass reflects cold rays of the moonlight.  
Narrator: You walk to the front of the cabin. As the wind blows through, you hear the doors and windows creaking.  
Narrator: You pull your jacket tighter around you for warmth.  
Joe: Maybe it was a hunter's cabin?  
Narrator: You peek through the window. Even in the dim light, you can see that decor inside is more sophisticated than that of a hunter's cabin.  
Danielle(smile): I don't think so. It looks more like a family home.  
Benjamin(happy): Wow, a family home in the Forbidden Forest? I just can't wait to find out who these brave people were.  
Danielle(angry): Maybe Mom came here...  
Benjamin(smile): Let's go inside and find out.
