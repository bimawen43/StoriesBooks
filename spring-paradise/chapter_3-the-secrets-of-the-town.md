Kohl: Give me more details.  
Danielle(sad): When we were at the Festival, I saw Gavin running...  
Kohl(sad): So you're the last one who saw him alive?  
Danielle(sad): I think so. I saw a man wearing a red cap, being chased. And the cap looked like Gavin's.  
Kohl(surprise): So you didn't see his face?  
Danielle(sad): No, but I'm sure it was him.  
Kohl: Kid, don't jump to conclusions with things like this.  
Narrator: You stammer, trying to come up with a response. Kohl just shrugs his shoulders and lifts his chin, gesturing at you to continue.  
Kohl: And what about the person chasing him? What did he look like?  
Danielle(sad): It was too dark to see across the lawn.

Kohl: Yes, dancing. You kids really know how to indulge.  
Kohl: Dancing, music, maybe a little alcohol. {Danielle Name}, did you drink?  
Danielle(angry): A little. But I know what I saw.  
Kohl: Kids run around and roughhouse at parties all the time. It doesn't mean anything.  
Danielle(angry): This wasn't just roughhousing. Something strange was going on.  
Kohl: {Danielle Name}, you're not even sure this person was Gavin.  
Kohl: You can't even tell me the gender of the other person.  
Kohl: It's hard for us to accept this as evidence.  
#### B  
Narrator: Sheriff Kohl frowns and silently stares at you. Uneasy, Joe moves a little. You could cut the tension in the room with a knife.  
Danielle(surprise): What? Did I say something wrong?  
Kohl: No. Tell me about it.  
Joe(sad): Sheriff Kohl, maybe {Danielle Name} is imagining things...  
Narrator: Kohl coughs loudly and glances at Joe, warning him with his eyes to quiet down, and then turns back to you.  
Kohl: {Danielle Name}, start from the beginning.  
Danielle(sad): It was probably nothing. I saw a pair of green eyes in the woods. Just for a second.  
Danielle(sad): And then they disappeared.  
Narrator: You recall the cold green eyes in the woods, feeling yourself tremble. Kohl looks at you, expressionless.  
Kohl: Why are you bringing this up? It's normal to see animals in the woods.  
Danielle(sad): Well, the position of the eyes was abnormally tall. Even taller than me.  
Kohl: Maybe it was a bat? Or a bird? Or something that crawled up a tree?  
Danielle(sad): No. I know this is going to sound stupid, but I saw something evil in those eyes.  
Kohl(surprise): What are you talking about?  
Danielle(sad): I just have a strange feeling that those eyes, that thing I saw... it might know something.  
Kohl(angry): Are you mocking me? This is a murder investigation, not some fairy tale. Wake up!  
Danielle(sad): But I really do feel that way...  
Kohl: Your imagination plays tricks on you when you're afraid, especially in the face of the unknown.  
Kohl: But it's just your imagination. It's not real.

Kohl(sad): We have some early results already.  
Danielle(surprise): You do?  
Kohl(sad): Brian told me he smelled alcohol on Gavin.  
Kohl(sad): I'm guessing he was drunk and he took off to explore the woods.  
Kohl(sad): Then he got attacked by a bear or something. And he called for help, but he couldn't make it.  
Danielle(sad): ... I don't buy that.  
Kohl: Look, kid, over the years, I have seen dozens of reckless punks.  
Kohl: They do whatever they want, no matter the consequences.  
Kohl: In the end, it's always the parents who end up suffering.  
Kohl(sad): I really wish you kids would listen to your parents. It's really a pity to see these things happen.

Narrator: You leap to your feet before the monster grabs you and run towards the source of the light.  
Narrator: Warm lamplight leaks through the gaps in the planks. And you see a peaceful cabin along the forest's edge.

Danielle: And there must be some important clues!

Narrator: Soon, you sneak out of your home and walk to the edge of the Forbidden Forest where Joe is already waiting for you ...  
Narrator: The wire mesh is already fixed and the blood has been washed clean.  
Danielle(surprise): How did it get so clean?  
Joe(sad): They probably wanted to stop rumors from spreading, you know.  
Narrator: You move closer to the fence and find the wires fixed, like they had never been broken at all.  
Narrator: Inside the mesh, even the grass that had been trampled on last night has been fixed.  
Danielle(surprise): It's weird... someone planted new grass!  
Narrator: You crouch down to look at the soil. It is wet and loose and suddenly you find a strange badge.

Joe(surprise): Don't be so loud.  
Danielle(surprise): Joe...  
# (ws_03n_09_nervous)  
## A. Why are you so nervous?  
## B. Do you think a monster will come out?  
#### A  
Joe(sad): {Danielle Name}... it's too complicated to explain.  
Joe(sad): Maybe I should get you away from these terrible things.  
Danielle(angry): Joe, you know what this strange badge is, right?  
Narrator: Joe sighs and nods his head.  
Danielle(angry): Tell me!  
#### B  
Joe(sad): {Danielle Name}, I'm not worried about a monster I've never seen...  
Danielle(surprise): What are you worried about then?  
Joe(sad): It's the strange badge , but it's hard to explain.  
Danielle(angry): Tell me!  
\***  
Narrator: Joe lowers his voice and double-checks your surroundings to make sure nobody's listening.  
\>>  
Joe(sad): All right, my dad once told me that...  
Joe(sad): In this town, there's a mysterious power responsible for maintaining order.  
Joe(sad): And this badge reminds me of it!  
Danielle(surprise): ...  
# (ws_03n_10_the_order)  
## A. What order?  
## B. What power?  
#### A  
Joe: An order that makes everyone tremble at the name of the Forbidden Forest.  
Danielle(surprise): How can that be?  
Joe(sad): With death, rumors, and legends. Anything that arouses terrors.  
Joe(sad): Think about it. Aren't you afraid of the Forbidden Forest now?  
#### B  
Danielle(surprise): Is the power... a bunch of people?  
Joe(sad): Maybe. My dad wasn't sure. He just told me to be careful.  
Narrator: Joe murmurs, and pulls up a picture of Gavin on his phone.  
Joe(sad): The truth comes at a price.  
\***  
Danielle(sad): Joe, you're scaring me.  
\>  
Narrator: Joe gives you a gentle hug.  
Joe(sad): I'm sorry. But that's why I don't want to talk about the Forbidden Forest.  
Joe(sad): It's for your safety, {Danielle Name}.  
Joe(sad): The power can make up a lie and fabricate a monster.  
Joe(sad): It's not for us to fight against!  
Danielle(sad): ...  
# (ws_03n_11_fight_against)  
## A. We can find someone to help.  
## B. We can't pretend nothing happened.  
#### A  
Joe(sad): No one will believe you.  
Joe(sad): Most of the people in town only know that there's a monster here.  
Joe(sad): You don't have proof of that power.  
Danielle: Then let's find it. As long as the power is real, we'll be able to find proof.  
Danielle: I really wish I could do something. I don't want to feel guilty when I think about Gavin.  
#### B  
Joe(sad): I just keep thinking about Gavin and I feel guilty. I could've saved him!  
Joe(sad): I know it's hard ...  
Danielle(smile): Maybe the horrors of this town aren't as horrible as you might think.
