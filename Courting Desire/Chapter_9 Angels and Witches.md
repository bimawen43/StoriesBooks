Alice(surprise): Philippe, what are you ——  
Philippe(sad): Are you a witch?  
Alice(surprise): What?? Of course not!  
Alice(sad): I don't understand...

(cd_09_01_are_you_witch)  
## A. Am definitely not a witch.  
## B. Can't explain what's going on either.  
#### A  
Alice: The only thing I know about witchcraft is from that show on television, <i>Charmed</i>.  
Philippe(surprise): What's 'television'?  
Alice(sad): Oh, er... It's a telecommunication medium... used to transmit, er, moving images...  
Alice(sad): Like watching a play, but on a screen instead of on a stage...  
Narrator: Philippe stares at you uncomprehendingly.  
Alice(sad): It's something we have, where I come from... It's really hard to explain.  
Alice(sad): Okay I realize that maybe I'm not doing a very good job to convince anyone that I'm not a witch.  
#### B  
Alice: I'm trying to figure out what this is all about too.  
Alice: How I got here... and if there's a way to go home.  
Alice: I definitely don't have the power to invade anyone's dreams. I'm trying to find answers too.

Alice: Anyway, I'm just a boring, ordinary girl.  
Philippe(smile): Oh, trust me, you're not boring in any way.  
Narrator: He steps closer to you again... so close that he's practically got you backed up against the door.  
\>>>  
Philippe: You're <i>extremely</i> interesting...  
Philippe: And I'm going to figure you out, no matter what it takes.  
Narrator: He takes yet another step forward, until he's pinning you against the door with his body.  
Narrator: His body is strong and lean, against your curves. His right hand slides around your waist...  
Narrator: You feel yourself blushing furiously.  
Alice(shy): Philippe, please... let me go...  
Philippe: What if I don't want to?  
Alice(sad): What about your engagement to Marie?

Alice: She <i>is</i> pretty.  
Philippe: There's nothing wrong with her <i>physically</i>...  
Philippe: But I'm not attracted to her personality.  
#### B  
Philippe: Does she?  
Alice: She's certainly very proprietorial.  
Philippe: Perhaps she senses a lack of enthusiasm on my part, and that makes her feel insecure.

## B. Oh you're such a flirt, stop it.  
## C. You want to be with me?  
#### A  
Philippe: I do.  
Alice: And what if I'm not an angel? What if I'm a witch?  
Philippe: Now that I think about it, someone as beautiful as you can't possibly be a witch.  
Philippe(smile): Therefore, the only other logical explanation is that you must have dropped from heaven.  
Philippe: But even if you <b>were</b> a witch, it's probably already too late for me anyway...  
Philippe: Judging from the way I can't get you out of my head.  
#### B

Philippe: Stop what?  
Alice: Flirting.

Philippe: I may have been like that, it's true... But I'm not like that anymore.  
Alice: I'm sure that all flirts say the same thing.  
Philippe: I'll prove it to you.  
#### C  
Philippe: Well, we've only just met...  
Philippe: But I definitely want to get to know you better.  
Philippe: In fact, I want to get to know you <b>very well</b>.
