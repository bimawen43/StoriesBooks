Alice(angry): Well, I don't know who you are.  
Anne(angry): That just proves my suspicions are right, that you're a nobody.  
Alice(angry): Excuse me??? Do you have any idea how rude you are being right now??  
Anne: Well, did I say something wrong?  
Anne: You're a nobody, pretending to be some kind of noblewoman...

Anne(angry): This ISN'T your room. This is a room in Armand's estate.  
Alice(angry): And I'm a guest in his estate.  
Anne(angry): Well, don't get too comfortable, because you'll be leaving soon!  
Alice(angry): Excuse me??  
Anne(angry): I'm going to make sure that Armand throws you out tomorrow!  
Alice(sad): Why would you do that?  
Anne(angry): You are obviously a fraud, pretending to be some kind of noblewoman...  
\***  
\>>>  
Anne(angry): And taking advantage of Armand's hospitality to live off of him!  
Alice(angry): I'm nothing of that sort!  
Alice(angry): And that's rich, coming from somebody who came uninvited into my room...  
Alice*Shout(angry): To hurl insults and threats at me!  
Alice*Shout(angry): Just who are you anyway?  
\>>  
Narrator: The woman draws herself up proudly, to her full height, and sneers at you.

\>>  
Alice(angry): But what were you doing in my room, in the middle of the night?  
Anne(angry): Well, what were you doing walking in the garden with Armand, in the middle of the night?  
Alice(angry): Okay firstly, I have every right to walk anywhere I want, with whoever I want.  
Alice: And secondly, you seem to have very little trust in your fiance...  
Alice: If you are jealous to the point that you have to ambush me in my room in order to interrogate me!  
Alice(sad): Which is super creepy, by the way.  
Anne(surprise): I... You...  
Alice: Cat got your tongue?  
Narrator: She takes two steps towards you, and stabs her finger at you.  
\>>>  
Anne(angry): You just stay away from Armand... or else.  
Alice(angry): Or else what?  
Anne: Or else, you'll see what I can do.

Jeanne: Oh, no. Lady Mazarin lives in the Royal Palace.  
Jeanne: She's the daughter of the King's Royal Advisor, Rene Mazarin.  
Jeanne(sad): But whenever Armand is in Paris, she's more frequently here than not.  
Jeanne(sad): She had dinner here last night, and as it was getting late, stayed here for the night.  
Alice: I see. She must have looked out of her window and seen us walking in the garden...  
Alice(sad): And then decided to come and warn me to stay away from Armand.

Alice: You definitely can trust me.  
Jeanne: Last year, when his Lordship was in Paris...  
Jeanne: Madame Montfort and her daughter, Lady Isabelle de Montfort, came to visit him.  
Jeanne: Madame Montfort had the intention to introduce Lady Isabelle to his Lordship...  
Jeanne: I believe in the hopes that his Lordship might take a liking to her, and maybe propose marriage.  
Jeanne: I know that Lady Isabelle fell for his Lordship as soon as they were introduced.  
Alice: Why am I not surprised.  
Jeanne: Yes, there are many young ladies who dream of winning his Lordship's affections...  
Jeanne: Since he is young, good-looking, extremely rich, and a Duke.  
Jeanne: Anyway, Lady Anne of course found out about it, and insisted on staying here as well, during that time.

Alice(surprise): But why on earth did she do that, if she had fallen for Armand, and wanted to win his affections?  
Jeanne(sad): Apparently, Lady Anne told Lady Isabelle that his Lordship had asked her to pass a message to her...  
Jeanne(sad): That he would visit her in her chamber that night, and to dismiss her handmaid for the night.  
Jeanne(sad): Lady Anne also convinced Lady Isabelle that it was his Lordship's wish...

Jeanne(sad): It just wasn't his Lordship, of course.  
Alice(surprise): But who was it?  
Jeanne(sad): It could have been anyone that Lady Anne had hired.  
Jeanne(sad): In the middle of the night, Lady Anne woke up the entire household.
