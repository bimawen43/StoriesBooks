Narrator: You're having tea with the Queen, who seems to have something weighing on her mind.  
Therese: Can I trust you?  
Alice(surprise): Madam, I promise that anything you tell me in confidence, I will keep it to myself.  
Narrator: The queen continues staring at you, as if reading into your soul... before making up her mind.  
\>>  
Therese(sad): It's been particularly lonely the past few weeks...  
Therese(sad): Not knowing who I can trust, after Louis was poisoned.  
Therese(sad): Can you imagine? <i>Anybody could have done it.</i>  
Therese: Well, except Armand, because he was in Bordeaux.  
Alice(sad): You're right, I can't imagine.  
Therese(sad): Court rumors have been brutal.  
\>  
Therese(angry): There are whispers floating around that, <i>'the Queen must have done it, perhaps she has a lover!'</i>  
Therese(sad): And also, <i>'it must have been Philippe, he wants to be King!'</i>  
Alice(angry): Hmm...  
# (cd_11_01_palace_rumors)  
## A. The rumors must have been started by someone.  
## B. Are the both of you the only ones being suspected?  
## C. Why do they dare to gossip about you and Philippe?  
#### A  
Alice(angry): Maybe by the very person who did it.  
Therese(angry): Perhaps.  
#### B  
Therese(sad): From what I have heard, it seems so.  
Therese(sad): And we need to be very careful because Court opinion is very powerful.  
Therese(sad): If it gathers enough supporters we could be tried on nothing but hearsay.  
#### C  
Alice(surprise): I mean, you're the <i>queen</i>, and Philippe's the <i>king's brother</i>!  
Therese(sad): Anybody can be taken down, {Alice Name}.  
\***  
Therese(angry): I must get to the bottom of this!  
\>>  
Therese(angry): First of all, to root out this enemy of Louis, hiding in the shadows.  
Therese: Secondly, to clear our names.  
Alice: Madam, Philippe and Armand are also trying to find out who the poisoner is.  
Alice: Have you spoken with them?  
Therese: No. I haven't spoken to anyone, before today.  
Therese: The thing is, I have my suspicions about who did it.  
Alice(surprise): You do? But then, <i><b>who is it??</b></i>  
Therese: Patience, I'll tell you everything. I've been pondering this for a long time...  
Therese: Everyday, in fact, ever since the royal physician said it could be poison.  
Therese: <b>Who could have a motive for wanting Louis dead?</b>  
Therese: <b>Who is powerful enough at court, and close enough to him to pull this off?</b>  
Therese: There is myself, and Philippe of course...  
\>>>  
Therese: And then there's <i>Rene Mazarin</i>.  
Alice(surprise): <b>Mazarin??</b>  
# (cd_11_02_criminal_suspect)  
## A. But why?  
## B. I knew there was something off about him!

Alice: But... what motive could Mazarin have for wanting the king dead?  
Therese: On the surface, it doesn't seem like he has anything to gain if Louis dies.  
Therese(angry): But then, remember how he arranged for Marie to marry Philippe?  
Alice: So if Louis dies, because the both of you don't have a son...  
Therese: Philippe becomes King of France, and Marie gets to be Queen.  
Alice: Oh my god... you're right.  
# (cd_11_03_renes_motive)  
## A. Then he does have a strong motive.  
## B. No wonder Marie wants to marry Philippe so badly.  
## C. Oh my god, this is like Game of Thrones.  
#### A  
Alice: His daughter becomes Queen, and he becomes more powerful than ever.  
#### B  
Alice: She just wants to be Queen.  
#### C  
Therese: Game of what?  
Alice: Oh, from the A Song of Ice and Fire series...  
Alice: Just a very popular series of books from back home... never mind.

Narrator: Temporarily surprised out of her own self-absorption, Anne looks up at you.  
Anne(surprise): Really? Who?  
Narrator: You shift uncomfortably in your seat.  
Alice: I don't really feel like talking about it.  
#### C  
Alice*Think(sad): Especially if the person doesn't love me back... Like in your case.  
\***  
Narrator: Anne falls silent again, lost in her own thoughts.  
Alice*Think(sad): I'm actually starting to feel sorry for her...  
Alice*Think(sad): She didn't ask for any of this either. But Armand only sees her as a friend.  
Alice*Think(sad): Should I try to advise her that it might be better for her to turn her affections elsewhere?

Alice*Think: Perhaps she genuinely isn't aware that Armand has only platonic feelings for her...  
\>>  
Alice: Anne...  
Anne(sad): Hmm?  
Alice: Have you ever tried speaking with Armand? To tell him about your feelings for him?  
Anne(surprise): Oh, I... Actually, no, I've never tried. Do you think I should?  
Alice: I think that you deserve to know where you stand with him.  
Alice: Whether he has romantic feelings for you... or not.  
Anne(surprise): I... You're right. I DO deserve to know!  
Anne(sad): But... but what if he tells me that he doesn't love me?  
Alice: At least you would know, once and for all.  
Alice: Anything's better than being stuck in a limbo like this, right?  
Alice: And you're young, and pretty... even if he doesn't love you, you must have plenty of other suitors, right?  
Anne(surprise): I do, actually.  
Anne: You know, I didn't expect you to tell me anything that would help...  
Message: Getting The Hint | You gently persuaded Anne to speak with Armand!  
Anne: But you actually have. Who would have thought?  
Alice: Er, you're welcome.  
#### B  
Alice*Think: She needs to face the facts. It's not fair for either her or Armand.  
\>>  
Alice: Anne...  
Anne(sad): Hmm?  
Alice: Don't you think it's time you stopped pining over someone who doesn't feel the same way for you?  
Anne(surprise): I...  
Anne(angry): {*Attention Excuse me???}  
Alice: I think you know deep down that Armand doesn't feel the same way for you.  
Alice: He's kind to you, but only because he sees you as a friend, maybe even a little sister.  
Alice: But his feelings for you are <i>purely platonic</i>. And deep down inside you know this.  
Alice: It's why you choose to sit and cry here by yourself, instead of speaking with him.  
Alice: You don't want to hear him telling you what you don't want to hear...  
Alice: Which is that he has no romantic feelings for you.  
\>>>  
Anne(angry): I... {*Attention How dare you!!}  
Alice(surprise): Have I said anything wrong?  
Anne*Shout(angry): Stop!!! Shut up!!!  
Alice: Come on, Anne. It's not fair for either you, or him, that you keep on being deluded this way.  
Narrator: She jumps to her feet and points a trembling finger at you.  
Anne*Shout(angry): I... I want you to get out!!! Get out!!!  
\>>  
Narrator: You stand up calmly.  
Alice: I will. But you know every word of what I'm saying is true.  
#### C  
Alice*Think: I'd better mind my own business.  
Alice*Think: She obviously won't want to hear anything from me, and besides...  
Alice*Think: This is something for Armand to tell her himself anyway.  
\>>  
Anne(sad): I don't know why I told you all of that anyway.  
Alice: Maybe you just needed to talk about it. Do you feel better at least, after talking about it?  
Anne(sad): Not really, no.

Alice*Think(surprise): It's the guard that I encountered here in the palace, when I first arrived!  
Alice*Think(sad): <i>The one who chased me!</i>

Palace_Guard1: I'm afraid so, miss. Lord Mazarin doesn't take no for an answer.

Alice(sad): I'm suffering from amnesia-  
Rene: Like I said, without a <i>feasible</i> explanation, and at a time when the king has just been gravely poisoned.  
Rene: You ingratiate yourself with the Duke and the Prince, you infiltrate the palace...  
Alice(surprise): {*Attention What??} I didn't <i>infiltrate</i> anything!

Rene: And the very fact that you're lying about it now, shows that you clearly have something nefarious to hide.  
Alice(sad): What?? It doesn't show anything!

Alice(sad): It's true that I was there, but I wasn't spying or anything that they were accusing me of doing!
