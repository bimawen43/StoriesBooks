Narrator: Philippe steps in close behind you.  
Philippe: I like to come here alone sometimes when the Court gets too maddening. Helps me think.  
Alice: It's very peaceful. I don't feel like I'm in Paris at all.

## B. I enjoy being with <i>you</i>.  
#### A  
Alice(sad): I just wish they would leave me alone.  
Philippe: Are they bothering you a lot? Do you need me to have a word with them?  
Alice(sad): Thank you but I think that might infuriate them and make things worse.  
#### B  
Narrator: Philippe grins at you.

Philippe(smile): I feel the same.  
Narrator: You feel your breath catch in your throat as he leans in even closer, his expression turning serious.  
Narrator: He reaches up his hand and tucks your hair behind your ear, in a startlingly intimate gesture.  
Philippe: {Alice Name}, I don't know why I dreamed of you, or why you're here...  
Philippe: But I'm glad you are.  
Narrator: You try to speak, but only manage a whisper.  
Alice: Me too.  
Narrator: You both stare into each other's eyes, neither seemingly willing to break the spell of this moment.  
Narrator: But then Philippe coughs, and takes a step back.

Rene: So you insist that you remember nothing about who you are or where you're from?  
Alice(sad): No, I don't remember anything.

Alice(shy): Bad? How so?  
Narrator: He gently tucks a lock of your hair behind your ear.  
Philippe: Bad because I can't afford to let myself be distracted right now, with the current danger in the palace.
