Narrator: As you slowly open your eyes, the first thing you notice, is that you seem to be lying on the ground.  
Narrator: The second thing you notice, is Armand's lips pressed against yours.  
Narrator: His lips are soft and warm, and for a brief, dreamy moment, you wonder if he is kissing you.  
Narrator: Suddenly, you start coughing, and he quickly rolls you over to your side as you hack out water from your lungs!  
\>>>  
Alice(cry): <i>Cough!!! Cough!!!</i>  
\>>  
Alice(sad): What... <i>cough</i>... what happened...  
Armand(sad): Don't try to talk yet, just rest first.  
Narrator: Another minute goes by as you keep coughing out water bit by bit, as Armand rubs your back.  
Armand(sad): Just keep breathing. In... out. In... out.  
Narrator: Your eyes slowly focus on him.  
Alice(surprise): Armand...

Narrator: Armand laughs out loud at your request.  
Armand(smile): I think you should be fine for now, if you're able to joke.

Narrator: It's only then that you remember with a sudden shock what had happened just a few moments before.  
Alice(sad): Oh my god, I was in the pond...  
\>>>

Alice(sad): <i>Cough...</i> Philippe.  
Philippe(sad): We heard screaming and ran over.  
Alice(surprise): You heard me screaming?  
\>  
Jeanne(sad): It was me, milady.  
Jeanne(sad): I'd just stepped out of the Palace, and was coming to find you...  
Jeanne(sad): When I saw you thrashing in the pond!  
Jeanne(sad): I screamed for help and his Grace and my Lord came running over.  
\>>  
Philippe: Armand jumped in the pond immediately, and pulled you out.  
Philippe(sad): You were unconscious by then.  
Armand(sad): We feared the worst...

## A. I owe you my life.  
## B. I need to stop getting in trouble like this.  
## C. How are you always around when I need you?  
#### A  
Narrator: Armand flushes slightly.  
Armand: You don't owe me anything.  
Alice: Seriously, that's two days in a row now that you've rescued me. How will I ever pay you back?  
Narrator: He flashes his dimpled grin.  
Armand: Well I don't mind rescuing you all the time... But maybe try to stay out of trouble from now on.  
#### B  
Alice(sad): It seems like ever since I've been here, trouble just keeps finding me.  
Jeanne(sad): Oh, milady, it was my fault. I should have been by your side!  
Alice: Nonsense, Jeanne. I was the one who asked you to wait for me in the Palace.  
#### C  
Alice: You're like my knight in shining armour.  
Narrator: Armand flushes slightly, even as Jeanne frowns in confusion.  
Jeanne: But my Lord is a Duke, not a knight. And he doesn't wear armour...  
Alice(smile): Ah ha ha, it's just one of our modern expressions.  
Armand: Knight in shining armour, huh? I like that.  
Narrator: His expression turns serious again.  
Armand: But I may not always be there when you need me.  
Alice(sad): I know. I'll need to be more careful from now on.  
\***  
Philippe: Speaking of which, if you don't mind me asking, Lady {Alice Name}...  
Philippe: How did you end up in the pond? Did you accidentally trip and fall in?  
Alice(angry): I did not.  
Philippe(surprise): Then how--  
\>>>  
Alice(angry): I was <b>pushed</b>.  
Philippe(surprise): <b><i>What??</i></b>  
Armand(surprise): Someone pushed you in the pond??  
Jeanne(surprise): Oh mon Dieu!  
\>>  
Narrator: You try to speak, but you start coughing again, and shivering.  
Philippe: Okay, we need to get you out of those wet clothes, and in bed to rest.  
Philippe: You can tell us what happened later.  
\>  
Philippe: Jeanne, please tell one of the chambermaids to prepare a chamber for Lady {Alice Name}.  
Jeanne: At once, your Grace.  
Narrator: As Jeanne hurries back towards the Palace, Philippe and Armand turn back to you.  
\>>  
Armand: Here, do you think that you can stand?  
Philippe: Perhaps it's better to let one of us carry you in.  
Armand: Yes, I think so too. Better not to exert yourself right now.
