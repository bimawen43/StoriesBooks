Caden(angry): Don't do that again.  
Narrator: Sam coughs, sputtering as the waves crash against him.  
Caden: There's a holding cell in a cave near the ——  
Sam(surprise): A cell?!  
Layla(sad): I thought you were taking us to see the King?  
Caden: I'm taking <i>you</i> to the King. Not the landwalker.  
Layla(angry)*Think: ...'Landwalker?'  
Layla(surprise): Can't we take him with us?  
Narrator: Caden pinched the bridge of nose and sighed.  
Caden(sad): He can't breathe underwater. So unless you have a transformation potion on you, no. He can't.  
Layla(surprise)*Think: The potion to make me human again!  
## A. Maybe it works in reverse, too!  
## B. If I'm human too, they won't separate us!

Narrator: You pull the vial you got from the witch's house and hold it up so Caden can see the label.

Narrator: You pull the vial you got from the witch's house and hold it up so Caden can see the label.

Narrator: Caden and the two soldiers glance at each other awkwardly... then start to laugh.

Caden(smile): Well this certainly makes things easier.  
Narrator: Caden swims forward, holding your wrist and taking the vial from your hand.  
Layla(surprise): {*Shake W-wait!}  
Caden(smile): You're wrong about the potion. It's for giving humans tails and gills.

Narrator: Sam stares at the tail swishing through the water. He tries to move and falls splashing back into the water.  
Layla(sad)*Think: Is this how I looked when I first transformed?  
Narrator: You swim close and take his arm, helping to steady him.  
Caden: Alright, enough delays. Let's move.

Narrator: You glare, focusing your magic until the bubble grows, swallowing him up in air.  
Soldier(surprise): Gah!  
Narrator: The soldier flails awkwardly, unable to swim or move as he's used to in the small container of air.  
Layla(smile): What? It's <i>hilarious!</i>

Narrator: As Caden moves to Sam and repeats the action, you notice a thin bioluminescent strand glowing between your wrist and Caden's.  
Caden: Let them go.  
Narrator: The two soldiers release their charges reluctantly. You wave your arm around, watching the line stretch between you.

Caden: It's a tether. Keeps you from running off.  
Layla: ...So yes, they're magical handcuffs.  
Narrator: Caden ignores that and kicked off, swimming forward.  
Caden: Keep up.  
Narrator: The guards hang back, letting you swim between them. You take Sam's elbow and help him swim.  
Layla(sad): Sam...?

Layla(surprise): Since he's gone to so much work to find me and all.  
Sam: So it's the whole 'If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead' thing?  
Narrator: He rubs at his face, frustrated. Your words don't seem to be helping much.

Layla(shy): ...Geeze, no pressure or anything.  
#### B  
Narrator: Caden opens his mouth to speak, then hesitates.  
Caden: I am in a particularly advantageous position to assist you.  
Caden: At least until the King realizes where I truly stand.  
#### C  
Caden(angry): I'd like our people to be able to eat, for one thing.  
Layla(sad): Oh, that's... Yeah. Important.  
Narrator: Caden huffs a startled little laugh.  
Caden(smile): Yes. Food's been growing more and more scarce.  
Caden(sad): The King blames the shallowtiders for overfishing.  
Layla(sad): Zale says that isn't true, though.  
Narrator: A conflicted expression crosses Caden's face.  
Caden(angry): I... don't know what's happening. That's the worst part.  
Caden(angry): Can't fix a problem unless you know what the problem is.  
\***  
Narrator: He lapses into awkward silence for a moment, then sighs.  
Caden: There's... something else, too.  
Caden: I didn't... choose this. Becoming the Shadow.  
Layla(surprise): Oh?  
Caden(sad): I... The King was looking for mer with certain talents.  
Caden(sad): Siren talents. The ability to control someone's mind.  
Caden(sad): And to ensure I did what he wanted, he took my family.  
Layla(surprise): Took them? What do you mean he 'took them?'  
Narrator: Caden blinks rapidly and looks away from you.  
Caden: They're working in the mines. Little more than slaves. They're completely under his power.  
Layla(surprise): Slaves?  
## A. That's terrible!  
## B. Is that... normal for your clan?  
#### A  
Caden(sad): It didn't used to be this way. But... everything's a mess recently.  
#### B  
Caden(sad): Not until recently, no.  
\***  
Layla(sad): He has your parents, then?  
Caden(sad): My mother. Don't have a father, not really.  
Layla(sad): I see.  
Caden(sad): My little brothers, too. Not even adults yet. And Kiri...  
Narrator: His eyes flash, somewhere between anger and sorrow.  
Caden(sad): Kiri's only five. She's not working yet, but she will be.  
Layla(sad): Caden... I'm so sorry.  
Caden(angry): If I hesitate... If I step out of line... Give him any reason to doubt me...  
Caden(angry): He makes their lives worse. Threatens to hurt them.  
Narrator: A muscle at his jaw jumps as he grits his teeth.  
Layla(sad): Caden...  
## A. I will do whatever I can.  
## B. I'm not sure I'm strong enough for this.  
## C. Why should I help you?  
\***  
#### A  
Layla(sad): Your family doesn't deserve that. You don't deserve that.  
Layla(sad): I will do whatever I can to free them. I promise.

#### B  
Layla(sad): I understand why you want things to change... I just don't know what I can do to help.  
Layla(sad): I've never even been to the Deep Sea Clan.  
Caden: All I ask is that you be willing to listen, to try.  
Caden: I know you didn't ask for this. You haven't met them yet, but they're your people.  
Caden(sad): And they need you. Desperately.  
Layla(sad): Caden, I...  
Layla(sad)*Think: I just want to go home.  
Caden(sad): Please, just consider. Wait until you get there.  
Caden(sad): See it for yourself. Keep an open mind.  
Layla(sad): Okay. I can do that at least.  
Narrator: He nods, bowing his head to you slightly.  
Caden: That is all I can ask of you.  
Narrator: He gives you a tight, sad smile.  
Caden(smile): I need to scout ahead. Take care of your human friend in the meantime.  
Narrator: Before waiting for a response, he kicks his fin and sails forward out of reach.  
#### C  
Layla(sad): It's awful, what's happened to you and your family. Truly.  
Layla: But it doesn't have anything to do with me. I didn't ask for this.  
Layla: I didn't even know there <i>was</i> a 'Deep Sea Clan' until like a week ago.  
Layla(angry): I didn't sign up to be a princess, or a hero, or whatever it is you're hoping for here.  
Caden(angry): ...  
Caden(angry): Fine.  
\***  
Caden: I need to scout ahead. Take care of your human friend in the meantime.  
Narrator: Before waiting for a response, he kicks his fin and sails forward out of reach.  
Narrator: You stop swimming, waiting for the others to catch up.  
Sam(surprise): So... what was that all about?  
Layla(sad): Politics.  
Sam(sad): Ahh... Can't even escape them here, huh?  
Layla(smile): Something like that...

Caden: It's late. We'll rest before continuing on. Farro, you have first watch.  
Soldier: Alright.  
Caden: Jasper, you and the human will take the left cave. I'll be in the right with the princess.  
Sam(angry): Hold on a second. You and {Layla Name} are going to be sleeping together?  
Layla(shy): S-Sam! It's not like that!  
Caden: It certainly isn't. There's safety to be considered here, as well as your escape.  
Narrator: Sam was still scowling. He waved his wrist, the tether wobbling between his arm and Caden's.  
Sam(angry): We can't get away. You said so yourself. So there's no reason she can't sleep with me.  
Narrator: Caden pulls himself up to his full height, tail flicking with expert ease to keep himself still while Sam tread water, flailing in place.  
Caden: Your Highness?  
Narrator: It took a moment for you to realize he was speaking to you.  
Layla(surprise): Uhh... Yes?  
Caden: You choose. It would be safer if you slept beside me, but ——  
Sam(angry): 'Safer' says the guy currently <i>kidnapping us</i>. {Layla Name}, come on.  
Narrator: All four present turn to look at you, awaiting your decision.

Narrator: He blinks at you, opens his mouth, then shuts it again.  
Caden: ...Why would you nail gelatin to a tree?  
Narrator: You roll your eyes.  
Layla(sad): Ugh. I don't know. Maybe because I'm traveling with it.  
Layla(sad): Forced to rely on it for my own safety as well as my friend's...

Narrator: Caden smirks, a light chuckle escaping under his breath.  
Caden(smile): Ah. No. I just thought if I said that, you'd stop talking.  
Narrator: He finally leaves the entrance and settles next to you, so close the tips of your fins are touching.  
Layla(smile): Well it didn't work. I'm going to keep talking until I get what I want.  
Caden(smile): And what is it that you want?  
Layla(shy): Um... I want...

## B. To talk until I fall asleep.  
## C. To be closer to you.

Layla(shy): Just talk to me. Tell me something. Anything.  
\***  
Narrator: Caden considers this a moment, then begins speaking in a low, soft voice.  
Caden: In our kingdom, the sun doesn't reach the cities.  
Caden: It's dark there. Pure dark. We light our houses with bioluminescence.  
Layla: Like... the stuff in fireflies?  
Caden: I don't know what that is. We get it from animals. Jellyfish and the like.  
Caden: So the whole city glows. It's a soft beauty. Quiet. Serene.  
Caden: Life is fragile there. It takes effort to thrive in the dark.

Caden: Our people are resilient, clever, subtle...  
Narrator: His eyes flick up to yours.  
Caden: Beautiful.  
Layla: You keep saying 'our people...'  
Caden: You are our princess, our future queen. You were born in the deep sea, just as I was.  
Layla: But...  
## A. It doesn't feel like it belongs to me.  
## B. My home is on land.  
#### A  
Caden: I imagine it doesn't right now. But it will.  
#### B  
Caden(sad): The sea can be your home, too, if you want it to be.  
\***  
Narrator: He shifts to face you and places his hands in the water above your arms.  
Caden: Is it alright if I use magic on you? Just to show you something?  
Layla(surprise): Sure... If it isn't dangerous.  
Caden: You're safe. I promise.  
Narrator: He moves his hands in the water and the temperature gets cooler. The water pressure builds, weighing on you.  
Caden: When you descend into the depths, everything gets heavy.  
Caden: It settles on you, holding you down, as if the water's taking you into its arms.  
Narrator: Like a weighted blanket, the water beneath his hands seems to do exactly as he says, hugging you close.  
Caden: To me, I don't feel entirely right unless that pressure is weighing me down.  
Caden: That feeling is part of me. It's home.  
Narrator: His voice seems so much closer now as he leans closer, working the magic against your skin.  
Layla: That sounds almost... romantic.  
Caden(smile): Maybe it is.  
Narrator: He moves his hands to your shoulders. The comforting pressure-weight of the water rolls over your body.  
Layla: Caden...

#### A  
Caden(shy): ...Maybe I am.

Narrator: He takes a deep, slow breath, as if getting himself under control.  
Caden(shy): We should sleep.  
Layla(smile): Together?  
Caden(surprise): ...!

Layla(happy): You should see the blush on your face.

Narrator: He quickly lays on his side, away from you, facing the doorway. You giggle again and lay beside him, just barely touching.  
Layla(smile): Goodnight.  
#### B  
Caden(smile): I look forward to you seeing it as well.  
Narrator: The magic slowly eases off until you're back to normal, then he pulls his hands away.

Layla(smile): I hope so, too.  
Caden: Now... Rest. We have a tiring day ahead of us.  
Layla(sad): Only if you rest, too.  
Narrator: He sighs, a brief exhale of bubbles, before settling onto the ground an arm's reach away from you.  
Caden: Very well. If you insist, Your Majesty.  
Layla(happy): Was that sarcasm? Did you just 'Your Majesty' at me with... snark!  
Caden(smile): You are mistaken. I hold nothing but respect for my monarch.

Layla(angry): It's the village you *attacked*.  
\*+shade2  
Caden(angry): Quiet. Stay close.  
Layla*Think: I should...  
## A. Go quietly.  
## B. Scream for help.  
#### A  
Narrator: You follow close behind Caden as he guides your group around the edge of the city, staying out of sight as much as possible.  
\*Camera Right 3  
Narrator: As you reach the canyon leading into the Deep Sea, Caden turns to you and speaks softly.  
\*CADEN_CAUSE +1  
Caden: Thank you.  
#### B  
Narrator: You shove away from him, swimming towards town, shouting as loudly as you can.  
Layla(surprise): <i>{*HeartBeat Help! Someone help, please! I'm ——}</i>  
Narrator: The magic on your wrist snaps taut and hauls you backwards through the water. Strong arms grab you from behind, a hand over your mouth, and press you down into the sand.  
Layla(surprise): Mmf ——  
Caden(angry): I <i>said</i>... Quiet.  
Narrator: Caden's body is pressed against your back, firm without hurting you, holding you down behind a large fan coral. The soldiers do the same with Sam.  
Narrator: After a tense few minutes, he releases you.  
Caden(angry): Don't try that again.  
Layla(shy): R-right...  
\***  
\*Camera Right 3  
Narrator: Caden leads your group to the ravine, the way down into the darkness.  
Caden: It's going to get dark, so hold onto me. The light will return.  
Narrator: Without any further hesitation, Caden loops his arm through yours and pulls you down into the dark.

\*Camera Right 0

\*Camera Left 5  
Narrator: You see the faint light from beneath you before you see the city itself. Bioluminescence casts everything in a soft glow.  
Layla(surprise): Oh wow...  
## A. It's beautiful!  
## B. That's kind of scary.  
#### A  
Layla(surprise): Something like this was down here this whole time?  
Caden: Yes. Keeping our secret from humans requires a lot of energy.  
#### B  
Layla(surprise): It's so... dark.  
Caden: You get used to it. Your eyes will adjust.  
\***  
Sam(sad): Don't the fish get scary this far down...?  
Caden(smile): Yes. They do.  
Narrator: Images of deep sea terrors float up in your mind... angler fish, bigfin squid, creatures that light up in the dark and have too many teeth...  
Layla(surprise): Oh my god... Those things are down here?  
Soldier(smile): Oh, sure. We feed princesses to them all the time.  
Narrator: The other soldier smacks his companion on the arm.  
\*Camera Middle 3  
Narrator: The heart of the city is bustling and bright like a city on earth. A beautiful tower rises above the city, taller than all the other buildings.  
Layla: That tower...  
Caden: That's the palace.  
Narrator: When you look around you, though, the effects of poverty are everywhere.There are dozens of mer begging for food, and a small crowd shouts beneath the palace.  
Layla(sad): ...  
Caden: Come on, this way.  
Narrator: He pulls you away from the palace tower and towards a number of open-air shops along the street.  
Narrator*Top: Merchant | Over here, miss!  
Narrator*Top: Merchant | A lovely woman like you deserves the best!  
Caden(angry): Ignore them. Come... There. Those shops.  
Narrator: A number of stalls have clothing and dresses hung up. They don't appear to have any customers.  
Layla(surprise): This market...  
## A. It's nearly empty.  
## B. It seems small for a capital city.  
\***  
Caden(sad): It wasn't always like this. Our city, our clan... We used to be thriving.  
Layla: Is this what you meant by wanting change?  
Narrator: He nods, saying nothing else, as you drift between the stalls with their noisy keepers until...  
Layla(surprise): Oh! That's... that's lovely.  
Caden: Good. Get it.  
Layla(surprise): Hang on! Isn't it a little... flashy?  
Caden: Flashy is good. The ladies of the court wear things like that all the time.  
Narrator: You think about it a moment, imagining what you would look like wearing it.  
\*Layla Outfit Prem_Majestic_Mermaid (Tag: Record)  
Layla(surprise)*Think: It's lovely..!  
Caden: Yes? Good?  
Layla(happy): You're so impatient! Trying to rush shopping...  
Narrator: He sighs and runs a hand over his face.  
Caden: It's perfect. And you will look perfect in it.  
Caden(shy): I mean... It's... suitable.  
Layla(smile)*Think: What should I do?  
\*Model  
## B. Wear what you have.  
## A. Buy the dress. (Cost: 29 Diamond ID: look_sld_12_clothes)  
#### A  
\*Layla Outfit Reset  
Layla: It's not for me. I want to meet my father as I am. Clothes and all.  
Caden(sad): I'm... not sure that's the wisest idea, but...  
Layla: I've made up my mind.  
Narrator: You turn to swim back to where Sam and the two soldiers are still waiting.  
#### B  
\*Gain MAJESTIC_MERMAID_12  
Narrator: The shopkeeper offers you a space behind a curtain to quickly change into the new outfit.  
Layla(shy): So... What do you think?  
\*Caden FLIRT +1  
Caden(surprise): ...I, um... It's...  
Narrator: He clears his throat, turning away.  
Caden(shy): It is fitting for an audience with the King.  
Narrator: You follow him as he swims back to where Sam and the two soldiers had fallen back.  
\*Sam FLIRT +1  
Sam(surprise): Woah... {Layla Name}. That outfit...  
Layla(shy): You like it?  
Narrator: He nods at you, a little dumbfounded.  
Sam(shy): You look like... a mermaid princess.  
Caden: Good. That's the intention.  
\***  
Narrator: You look up at the palace spire looming over you.  
Layla(sad)*Think: I'm going to see my father...  
Sam(sad): You ready for this, {Layla Name}?  
Layla: Well...  
## A. No, but I don't have a choice.  
## B. I'm ready as I'll ever be.  
## C. I've been waiting for this moment.  
#### A  
Sam(sad): Right. Nothing like armored guards to make that painfully clear.  
Narrator: Sam puts a warm hand on your shoulder, giving it a gentle squeeze.  
Sam(sad): I'll be with you the entire time. As long as I can be.  
#### B  
Layla: It's now or never I guess, right?  
Narrator: Sam puts a warm hand on your shoulder.  
Sam(smile): You got this.  
Layla(smile): Thanks.  
#### C  
Layla(smile): And now it's finally here. I'm going to meet my <i>father.</i>  
Narrator: Sam smiles at you and puts a warm hand on your back.  
Sam(smile): I'm sure he'll love you.  
\***  
Narrator: Caden swims with your group, leading you up to the tower. One of the palace guards stops him at the entrance.  
Soldier(angry): Identify yourself.  
Caden: I am the Shadow of the King.  
Caden: And I have something that belongs to him.
