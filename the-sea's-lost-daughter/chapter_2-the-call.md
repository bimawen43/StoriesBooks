## A. Sorry for bothering you...  
## B. Damn. You know how to make an entrance.  
#### A  
Layla(surprise): Hi... I'm sorry for bothering you.  
Layla(surprise): I didn't realize this cave was, um... occupied.  
\>>  
Zale(happy): Haha, don't worry about it.  
Zale(smile): No one owns the cave. It's open to anyone.  
Narrator: He swims closer to the rocky outcropping you're sitting on.  
Zale(smile): And having you here is a nice surprise.  
Layla(surprise): It is?  
#### B  
Layla(surprise): You looked like the Little Mermaid coming up out of the water like that.  
Narrator: He raises an eyebrow at you.

Zale: Too bad I left my seashell bra at home.  
Narrator: You laugh and he grins, swimming closer to the rocky outcropping you're sitting on.

Zale(smile): Hey. I'm Zale.  
\*Zale Name Zale  
Layla(smile): Zale... That's pretty unusual.  
Zale(happy): Yeah. If you can't tell, I'm not from around here.  
Layla(happy): Oh! Are you on vacation too? I'm renting a beach house here for the summer.  
Narrator: Zale folds his arm on the rocks, giving you full view of his biceps.  
Narrator: ...And the saltwater dripping from his long hair onto his shoulders...  
Narrator: ...Each drop slowly trailing over his chest...  
Layla*Think(surprise): Geeze, get a grip!  
Narrator: Zale smirks at you as if he can tell exactly what you're thinking.  
Zale(smile): Nah, not on vacation.  
Zale: I was investigating some disturbances coming from this area, but the tides changed too quickly.  
Zale: Ended up stuck in this cave overnight, but the tides are changing, and--  
Layla(surprise): You've been stuck in a cave all night?!  
# (sld_02_02_all_night_long)  
## A. I'll go for help! You need a doctor!  
## B. How are you so calm about this?!  
#### A  
Layla(surprise): I can call for help. Are you hungry? Do you need food?  
Layla(surprise): Get out of the water! We need to keep you warm...  
Narrator: Zale throws his head back and laughs, the deep sound echoing off the cave walls.  
Zale(happy): Oh man... You're so sweet. I'm fine. I don't need any of that.  
Layla(surprise): But--  
Zale(happy): Look at me! I'm fine. Seriously, though, thanks for worrying about me.  
Narrator: He leans into your space, suddenly very close to you.  
#### B  
Layla(surprise): Acting like it's no big deal, like this happens everyday.  
Narrator: You imitate Zale's deep voice.  
Layla(angry): Trapped overnight in a cave, whatever... Not as bad as the time I wrestled a shark.  
Narrator: Zale throws his head back and laughs, the deep sound echoing off the cave walls.  
Zale(happy): Oh man... I hope I don't sound like that.  
Zale(smile): And for the record, wrestling sharks is a waste of time. Just punch 'em in the nose.  
Layla(surprise): Oh my god, you actually <i>do</i> wrestle sharks, don't you?!  
Narrator: Still laughing, he leans forward, suddenly very close to you.  
\***  
Zale(smile): You know... You never told me your name.

Layla(surprise): Not like a hallucination or anything! But just...  
Layla: I don't know. Some kind of flash of light.  
Narrator: Zale stares at you a long moment.  
Zale: And you have no idea what it is?  
Layla(sad): No... Maybe something's wrong with me...

Layla: I'll be there in a minute!  
Narrator: But when you turn back...  
Layla(surprise): He's... gone?  
Narrator: You hear a splash in the open water outside the cave and see Zale waving at you.

Sam(sad): You've been acting kind of weird recently.  
Maddie(sad): Weirder than usual.  
Sam(sad): Talking about... seeing things...  
Layla(sad): I know. I think you were right, Sam. Migraines can mess with your vision, you know?

#### B  
\*Play Music doubts  
Maddie(sad): If you ever need someone to talk to, you know I'm here for you.  
Layla(smile): I know. It's just kind of something I have to work through on my own, you know?  
Narrator: Maddie squeezes you tight, then lets you go.  
\***  
Sam: Do you think you're still up for the hike tonight?  
Layla(happy): I wouldn't miss it.

Narrator: That evening, you and your friends hike together up a seaside cliff.  
Layla(surprise): Are you sure the two of you don't need any help?  
Narrator: Shaun and Sam carry a heavy cooler between them.  
Sam(happy): We've got this. Don't worry about it.  
Shaun(happy): Yeah, let us show off for you girls a little.  
Narrator: Maddie giggles and snaps pictures of the boys.  
Addison: ...  
Layla: You've been awfully quiet, Addison...  
Narrator: She glances at you, then walks faster.  
Addison: Sam was worried about you all afternoon.  
Narrator: You struggle to catch up with her, leaving your other friends far behind.  
Layla(sad): I know he was... I apologized--  
\*Play Music sad2  
Addison(angry): He was <i>frantic</i> when he couldn't find you.  
Addison(angry): He thought it was his fault, that you were running away from <i>him.</i>  
Layla(surprise): Addison... I didn't mean--  
Addison(angry): You have no appreciation for what you have.  
Narrator: She gets in your face, and you take a step back.  
Addison(angry): You don't deserve him.  
Narrator: You take another step back and realize how close you are to the cliff's edge.  
Layla(surprise): Addison...

Layla(sad): I'll talk to him and apologize for everything.  
Addison(angry): ...  
Narrator: Addison takes another step towards you.  
Addison(angry): Not good enough.  
#### B  
Addison(angry): It doesn't. That's exactly the problem.  
Narrator: Addison shouts in your face and you stumble back another step.  
Addison(angry): As long as you're around, Sam can't see anything but you.  
#### C

Addison(angry): How dare you!  
Narrator: She pokes a finger into your chest, forcing you backwards.  
\***  
Layla(surprise): Addison... Back up... This isn't safe!  
Narrator: You try to push forward, but your foot slips on the uneven ground.  
Layla(surprise): Ahh!  
Addison(surprise): {Layla Name}!  
Narrator: You scramble to hold onto the cliff, but it's no use...
