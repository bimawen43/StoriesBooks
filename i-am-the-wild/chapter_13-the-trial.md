Narrator: You have a seat in the defendant's box.  
Narrator: It's nothing more than a hard wooden table with even harder wooden chairs.  
Narrator: You adjust your back, two Night brothers on each side.  
Narrator: Derek shuffles through the paperwork he's brought.  
Narrator: Elijah pulls legal textbooks out from his bag.  
Eve*Think(sad): I feel like I should be doing something, but I don't know what!  
# (iatw_13_01_learn_about_the_court)  
## A. Learn how the court will go! (Cost: 15 Diamond ID: plot_iatw_13_court)  
## B. Stay quiet.  
#### A  
\>>  
Eve(sad): I'm not sure how any of this goes.  
Sabastian(happy): Don't worry, {Eve Name}. Let us handle the prep work.  
Eve: So how does all of this work? Anything I should know about beforehand?  
Sabastian: The judge will appear and we will begin. The prosecutor will state the charges against Dracula.  
Sabastian: Our investigation will be presented.  
Sabastian(smile): So Elal and Ifi, the coroners. Their report will be presented.  
\>  
Elal: ...  
Ifi(smile): ...  
\>>  
Sabastian: I feel Lilith will likely have time to speak.  
Sabastian: Then we will present our case.  
Sabastian(smile): The prosecutor will bring in any witnesses or expert testimonies.  
Sabastian: Those brought up to speak will be cross-examined by the prosecutor and one of us.  
Sabastian: Once we've gone through everything, the jurors will decide Dracula's fate.  
Sabastian(smile): He will either be killed for the death of Mary and their child...  
Sabastian(smile): Or found not guilty, if we have any say in it.  
Eve: Our case doesn't seem to look all that great...  
Sabastian: Well... we've found no evidence that Dracula murdered Mary. That's good.  
Sabastian: And we have evidence that Mary was unfaithful.  
\>>>  
Eve(sad): Either with Liam or Lilith. Still not sure on that one.  
Sabastian: Yes. Lilith wrote those love letters to Mary.  
Sabastian(smile): And our Memory Catcher caught Liam helping Mary with her pregnancy.  
Sabastian: Something the prosecutors don't know, with any luck.  
\>>  
Sabastian: Remember, {Eve Name}. It's not our job to disprove Dracula murdered Mary.  
Sabastian(smile): We're defendants. It's the prosecutor's job to prove Dracula killed Mary.  
Sabastian: And we have plenty of arguments to use against whatever the prosecutor has.  
Eve: Innocent until proven guilty.  
Sabastian: Exactly.  
\>  
#### B  
Narrator: You twiddle your thumbs, absorbing the strangely similar architecture of your old world.  
\***  
Narrator: Every bench behind you is filled with spectators wanting to see Dracula.  
Eve*Think(surprise): This feels more like a celebrity spotting than a court of law!  
Narrator: Lining the wall to your side is a hodge-podge of human-looking creatures.  
Narrator: Most of them appear to be dryads.  
Narrator: One large man appears half-ogre, given away by his boxy frame and bald head.  
Narrator: They all silently keeping to themselves.  
Narrator: You lean into Sabastian, whispering.  
\>>>  
Eve(surprise): <i>Is that the jury for this case?</i>  
Narrator: Sabastian nods.  
Sabastian: Unlike your world, the judge chooses the jury.  
Sabastian: It's based on a pool of interspecies candidates with legal training.  
Sabastian: The dragon does the vetting for impartiality himself.  
Sabastian: If the judge is to be trusted, all of these folks will judge Dracula fairly and decide his fate.  
\>  
Narrator: You stare at each of the jurors.  
Narrator: Most of them stare at the ground, doing their best to stay focused.  
Narrator: The deciders of not just Dracula's fate, but the Night brothers as well.  
Narrator: Your stomach turns in a knot.  
\>>  
Eve*Think(sad): If we win this case, the Night brothers are going to kill themselves.  
Eve*Think(sad): But if we lose, they'll be cursed by Dracula forever!  
Eve*Think(sad): Talk about a lose-lose situation...  
Eve*Think(sad): Should I bring it up again?  
# (iatw_13_02_lose_situation)  
## A. Focus on the court case.  
## B. Bring it up.  
#### A  
Eve*Think(sad): I'll talk to them about it later. We need to focus!  
#### B  
Eve(sad): This is a weird time to bring this up, but I can't help but think about how this case ends.  
Eve(sad): Even if we do win, you're all going to use your freedom to die.  
Eve(sad): I want Dracula to go free, I do. But I'd be lying if I said I don't want you all to leave me...  
Elijah(sad): I know, {Eve Name}. But after the centuries of pain and suffering we've committed as druids...  
Derek(sad): We can't bear to live any longer.  
Liam(angry): Enough. We will talk about that decision once it's actually available to us.

Narrator: The court doors swing open in dramatic fashion, silencing the chitter-chatter of everyone.  
Narrator: The four brothers turn around.  
\*Camera Left 2  
Narrator: You watch Moira Van Helsing stride in with all of the confidence in the world.  
Narrator: A chill runs down your spine.  
Eve*Think(sad): There she is. Moira Van Helsing. From a family of werewolves. Monster.  
Eve*Think(sad): Prosecutor.  
Narrator: Her gaze is cold, like she could freeze you in ice with one glare.  
Narrator: She glides her way to the opposite side of the court, sitting in the prosecutor's box.  
Narrator: It's not until she sits and leans backward that she finally peers over at you.  
Moira(happy): Good to see you, boys.  
Sabastian(angry): Moira.  
Liam(angry): You're lucky Dath'Racul didn't throw you off this case the second he saw your name.  
Liam(angry): Your hate for vampires is the worst kept secret in our world.  
Narrator: But Moira only smirks at the comment, tossing her head at the audience behind you.  
Moira(happy): Yes well, lucky for us nobody wants to see Dracula walk off.  
Eve*Think(sad): She sure seems confident...  
# (iatw_13_03_confident_moira)  
## A. You're going down.  
## B. We don't have a chance.  
## C. Stay quiet.  
#### A  
Moira(happy): Is that so, little girl?  
Moira(smile): You're awfully confident, {Eve Name}.  
Eve(surprise): You know who I am?  
Moira(happy): Better than you realize, my lovely.  
#### B  
Moira(smile): You should listen to your little assistant, boys.  
Moira(happy): Clearly {Eve Name} is smarter than all of you.  
Eve(surprise): You know who I am?  
Moira(happy): Better than you realize, my lovely.  
#### C  
Narrator: Ignoring Moira, you do your best not to let her get in your head.  
\***  
Eve: Whatever. She seems to have evidence, though.  
Eve(sad): Is that a problem?  
Derek: Relax.  
Derek: We didn't find anything to help us, but that can only mean Moira couldn't find anything either.  
Derek: Our lack of evidence isn't necessarily a bad thing.  
Derek: It only means this will come down to convincing the jurors emotionally that Dracula is a good man.  
\*Camera Middle 2  
Narrator: Moira shoots out from her chair. She turns and faces the audience, clearing her throat.

Narrator: Shooing your head up, a scream nearly leaves your mouth as a dragon soars down to the court.  
Narrator: It comes crashing down with a smash, nearly crumbling the tiled marble floor underneath you all.  
Narrator: You grip the table as the dragon's massive wings nearly blow you away.  
\>>  
Eve*Think(surprise): Oh my God! I've never seen such a massive thing before!  
Narrator: But the Night brothers are totally unphased, the sight of a dragon like nothing to them.  
Derek(sad): Oh no.  
Sabastian(angry): Curses. It's Dath'Racul.  
Eve(surprise): Dath what?  
Liam(angry): This is not a great start for us.  
\>  
Narrator: He slowly shrinks in size to fit the judge's box in front of you.  
Narrator: His tail wraps around, hidden from your view as he perches himself comfortably.  
Elijah(sad): Dath'Racul. He's the dragon of fire.  
Sabastian(angry): Making him significantly more passionate than the other dragons.  
Narrator: Across the court, Moira winks at you and the Night brothers, as if she knows what we're saying.  
\>>  
Sabastian(angry): Moira must have had a hand in this. Chose Dath'Racul on purpose.  
Eve(surprise): Why would she do that?  
Elijah(sad): It's easier to convince an emotional, passionate judge that someone murdered their wife.  
Sabastian(sad): This doesn't look good for us, brothers.  
Eve*Think(sad): It really doesn't.  
# (iatw_13_04_the_dragon_of_fire)

Eve(sad): The deck seems stacked against us.

Narrator: Everyone seats themselves back down in unison.  
Narrator: You're last to sit, still learning the correct customs of this world's court proceedings.  
Narrator: But your tardiness at sitting catches the eye of the terrifying Dath'Racul.  
Narrator: You gulp and stare downwards, avoiding eye contact with the judge.  
Narrator: A door behind the dragon opens as Dracula steps forward.  
Narrator: With the same suit as before, he gently seats himself close to the judge.  
Narrator: But he's not filled with the same confidence you've seen before.  
Narrator: His face drops with concern and anxiety.  
Eve*Think(sad): He knows this might be his last day of living...  
\*Play Sound s_roar3  
Racul: Let us begin. This is regarding the matter of the Otherworld vs Vlad Dracula.  
Racul: Moira. As the prosecutor of this case, you may begin your opening statement.  
Narrator: Moira stands, approaching the bench.  
Narrator: Dracula's head rises, meeting Moira. The eyes of the enemy.  
Narrator: The woman trying to put him away forever.  
Narrator: But she matches his eyeline with her own, empty gaze.  
Moira: Your honor, we are here to settle the charges against Dracula.  
Narrator: but Moira immediately turns and speaks to the jurors.  
\>>  
Eve*Think(surprise): She's a good prosecutor. She knows the judge isn't the one to convince.  
Eve*Think(sad): It's the jurors. That's why she's focusing so much on them!  
\>  
Moira: Two counts of murder. Two counts of unlawful draining of blood.  
Moira: And two counts of violating the Non-Violence Vampire Act.  
Moira: In vernacular terms, Dracula murdered his wife Mary and their son, drained them, and ran away.  
Narrator: Moira pauses, dramatically shaking her head at the severity of the charges.  
\>>  
Eve*Think(sad): She knows how to play the emotions of the jurors. This is going to be a hard case.  
\>  
Moira: We intend to show that Vlad Dracule, also known as Dracula, has a history of violent crimes.  
Moira: That he was abusive to his wife. And worst of all...  
Moira: That when he found out she was cheating on him, he killed Mary and her child in brutal fashion.  
Narrator: Dracula's eyes narrow. His mind likely wanders to fantasies of killing Moira now.  
Narrator: But he keeps quiet, the only request by the Night brothers.  
Narrator: Derek leans and whispers to his brothers.  
\>>>  
Derek: They'll need proof of an affair. Otherwise it's just speculation.  
Derek: And there isn't any proof. We already looked.

Lilith: ...  
Narrator: With the same clothes as earlier when you met her, she feels out of place.  
Narrator: Her long black hair and stone-like demeanor matched the glass of blood and fireplace of her home.  
Narrator: But the bright courtroom lights shine on her, revealing the truth.  
Narrator: Cracks on her face from a millennia of life show a tired, lost soul.  
\*Camera Middle 2  
Narrator: She has a seat, sworn in by Moira.  
Moira: What is your relationship with the defendant?  
Lilith: I am his sire, and he was my husband for several hundred years.  
Narrator: Her bell-like voice carries through the courtroom.  
Moira: And how would you describe your marriage with Dracula?  
Lilith: We're divorced. That should tell you enough.  
Narrator: Moira gazes up at the judge, clearing her throat.  
Racul: Ma'am, this is a court of law. I would ask that you answer the questions specifically.  
Racul: For the sake of clarity among our jurors.  
Narrator: Lilith grinds her teeth, nodding.  
Moira: Perhaps I should rephrase the question.  
Narrator: Moira begins pacing around the courtroom.  
Moira: You were married to Vlad for a long time. You know him better than anyone else in this room.  
Moira: Would you consider him violent? Do you think he could have killed Mary?  
Narrator: Lilith's gaze hits you, her eyes unfamiliarly soft.  
\>>  
Eve*Think(surprise): She's thinking about our conversations before.  
Eve*Think(surprise): She knows I know she was having an affair with Mary.  
Eve*Think(surprise): But Dracula took him away from her. Is she really going to hold that against him?  
Narrator: Lilith turns to Dracula, his eyes draped on his ex-wife.  
Narrator: She holds his life in her hands and he knows it.  
Lilith: Vlad. My lovely.  
Narrator: The two former lovers stare at each other.  
Lilith: Please answer me this, Vlad.  
Lilith: Did you love Mary?  
Narrator: Dracula turns to the Night brothers with a wide-eyed stare, wondering if he can answer.  
Narrator: Derek nods a yes. Dracula clears his throat, returning his gaze to Lilith.  
Dracula: Yes.  
Narrator: Dracula's voice cracks with a heart-broken pain.  
Narrator: Lilith stares at Dracula, scanning and analyzing his face.  
Narrator: Her expression softens, as if the pain in his voice is familiar to her.  
Eve*Think(sad): She knows he's telling the truth. Because of the pain he feels, she also feels!  
Narrator: Lilith nods at her ex-husband, a smile returning on her face.  
\>  
Narrator: Moira shifts her weight, uncomfortable and frustrated.  
Moira: I'm the one examining you, Lilith. I am the one asking questions here.  
Lilith: Then allow me to answer yours, dear.  
Narrator: Lilith sits straight, a familiar confident smirk back on her face.  
Lilith: Dracula was a sweet husband. Kind. Fair. Loving.  
Lilith: There is no doubt in my mind...  
Lilith: That Dracula did not kill Mary. It's impossible. He loved her.  
Narrator: This throws Moira off. She storms back to her desk, flipping through papers.  
Moira(angry): I have you on record referring to him as <b>'violent in nature'</b>.  
Narrator: Sabastian shoots out of his seat.  
\>>>  
Sabastian(angry): Objection, your honor. Leading the witness.  
\>  
Racul: Sustained. Prosecutor, please keep your statements objective.  
Racul: Just because Lilith called Dracula violent doesn't mean he murdered Mary.  
Moira: Of course, your honor.  
Moira: Lilith, how many people have Dracula killed?  
Lilith: You'd have to ask him that.  
Moira(angry): Have you ever seen Dracula kill someone?  
Narrator: Lilith, beams a sarcastic eye-roll at Moira.  
Lilith: We're vampires, sweetheart. Some of the oldest. What do you think?  
Moira(happy): But it's certainly a possibility that Mary had secrets about Vlad...  
Moira(happy): Secrets you are intimately aware of...  
Narrator: This catches Lilith off guard, her eyes going wide.  
\>>  
Eve*Think(sad): Oh no! Does Moira know Lilith loved Mary?

Narrator: Everyone in that room stares at you. Your lungs seize.  
Moira(angry): Excuse me?  
Racul(angry): Yes, what is it, young one?  
\>>>  
Eve(angry): The prosecutor is asking for information regarding the intimate details of Lilith's life.  
Eve(angry): Specifically, intimate and romantic details of Lilith's life.  
Eve(angry): While these are relevant in relation to Dracula, there is no existing relevancy beyond that.  
Eve: As much, the prosecutor's questions regarding Lilith's romantic life outside of Vlad...  
Eve(angry): ...Can't be considered relevant to this case.  
Eve(sad): That is... unless the prosecutor can prove relevancy.  
\>>  
Eve: So... I ask the prosecutor.  
Eve(angry): Do you have any evidence that connects Lilith's romantic life outside of Vlad to this case?  
Narrator: A puff of smoke escapes the dragon's nose. But Dath'Racul nods, convinced by your argument.  
Narrator: Moira snarls at you. She knows Lilith was in love with Mary. You know it. But nobody else does.  
Narrator: Moira knows it makes Lilith look biased in front of the jurors. And you're stopping her from sharing that fact.  
Narrator: Through grinding teeth, Moira sighs.  
Moira(sad): No... I have no evidence.  
Narrator: You smirk, a small victory shoots adrenaline through your veins. You go in for the kill.  
Eve(angry): Then I move to dismiss the witness. Her romantic life shouldn't be unfairly presented.  
Eve: Especially not to a room full of strangers.  
\>>>  
Eve(angry): How are we to know how this audience will react? How people will treat Lilith?  
Eve(angry): That is... unless we wish to put Moira on trial for slander and blasphemy?  
\>  
Moira(angry): Enough, child. You've made your point.  
Narrator: Returning a smug smile Moira's way, you have a seat.  
Narrator: Lilith smiles at you, a thanks for helping.

Lilith(sad): I suppose it's possible Vlad had reasons to be upset at Mary.

Moira: Permission to treat the witness as hostile?  
Racul: Granted.  
Moira: Lilith, isn't it true you claimed Vlad was abusive and volatile?  
Lilith: He was never abusive. And I found him more calculated than volatile.  
Narrator: Grunting in frustration, Moira stomps off, returning to her seat.  
Moira: No more further questions, your honor.  
Narrator: As she steps back, Derek rises.  
Moira(angry): It appears you got to Lilith after we did...  
Narrator: Derek only winks at Moira as he struts forward.  
Racul: Derek Night, you may begin your examination of the witness.  
Derek(smile): Only one question, your honor.  
\>>  
Derek(happy): Lilith.  
Derek(smile): Based on what you know of Vlad, do you think he's capable of killing his wife and child?  
Lilith(smile): Not in the least. He wanted a child more than anything.  
Lilith(smile): He never would have harmed Mary of their baby. He loved them too much.  
Narrator: And with that, Derek nods at the judge and returns to his seat.  
Narrator: You and the brothers lean into each other, whispering.  
Sabastian(smile): Well this went better than we thought.  
Liam: Whatever {Eve Name} said to Lilith must have worked.  
Narrator: But your eyes wander to Moira. Her cold demeanor stays the same.  
Eve*Think(surprise): She still seems as confident as ever!  
Narrator: She quietly approaches your bench, a smug smile on her face.  
Moira(happy): You may have won over Lilith, but it doesn't matter.  
Moira(happy): I have a killer witness that will put this case to bed. Now.  
\>  
Racul: Moira, you may continue with this case.  
Moira: Your honor, the prosecution calls Jerome Van Helsing to the stand.  
Narrator: Now, all four brothers stand up in defiance.  
Sabastian(angry): Excuse me?  
Derek(angry): Hold on, Moira. You can't call your own brother to the stand.  
Liam(angry): What are you trying to pull, Van Helsing?  
Derek(angry): Your honor, the Van Helsings have a history of bias against vampires.  
Derek(angry): The mere fact that Moira is the prosecutor of this case raises concern.  
Derek(angry): But to call a Van Helsing as a witness... clearly they can't be objective.  
Elijah: Besides the fact that he's not even on the witness list.  
Moira: Your honor, new evidence only recently came to light.  
Moira: With how rushed this case has been, the prosecution requires an expert testimony.  
Moira: I believe this evidence was withheld by the Night Brothers.  
Moira: As such, I am legally allowed to present this evidence.  
Moira: And an expert witness can share a professional opinion on this evidence without cross-examination.  
Narrator: A silence falls over the courtroom as Dath'Racul considers this.  
Racul: I will not argue with your logic, Moira. As such, I will allow your brother to speak.  
Racul(angry): But be warned, prosecutor. This is highly unorthodox.

Jerry(happy): I have a small private practice in the mundane world.  
Jerry(smile): You know... help the pathetic little humans with their simple problems with my expert.  
Eve*Think(angry): He's such a jerk.

## A. Call him a name.  
## B. Leer at him.  
## C. Ignore him.  
#### A  
Eve(angry): You're a fool.  
Narrator: Moira spins around at you.  
Moira(angry): Will this court allow the defendant's employees openly attacking witnesses?  
Racul: No. Watch your tongue, young one.  
Narrator: Sabastian smacks his lips with a pointed finger, telling you to stay quiet.  
#### B  
Narrator: You leer at Jerry, hatred flowing through your veins.  
#### C  
Narrator: You roll your eyes.  
\***  
Moira: It's fair to say you are an expert at the analysis of violent behavior?  
Jerry: Very.  
Moira: And you're familiar with Dracula's charges?  
Jerry: Yes. Sad business, a father murdering his wife and child.  
Moira: Dr. Van Helsing, you have examined all of the evidence presented in this case.  
Moira: Lilith's testimony. The coroner report from Elal and Ifi.  
Jerry: Yes.  
Moira: So you are aware that the coroner's notes mention that Mary may have loved someone else?  
Jerry: I am aware.  
Moira: Do you think Mary may have had an affair.  
Jerry: Certainly a possibility.  
Moira: Based on your expert opinion, do you believe Dracula is violent?  
Jerry: The evidence is quite clear that he is.  
Narrator: Moira motions back to your table for clarification. Sabastian stands.  
Sabastian: Moira, we aren't arguing that Dracula isn't violent. Of course he is.  
Sabastian: That certainly doesn't mean he murdered his wife.  
Moira: Excellent. I'm happy to hear that the defendants agree that Dracula is violent.  
Narrator: Moira returns to her table, flapping open the bag she brought in.  
Narrator: She pulls out a Memory Catcher.  
Narrator: Your Memory Catcher. The one you used on Dracula's butler and the cat outside of the villa.  
\>>>  
Eve(surprise): Where did she get that?!  
Sabastian(angry): Oh my God. She must have stolen it from us when she visited our mansion!  
Derek(angry): How did she know we had that?!  
Liam(angry): Sabastian! How did you let this happen?!  
\>>  
Sabastian(sad): I don't understand... I gave it to our grandmother after we used it.  
Eve(sad): And it's not like Matilda would have given it to her.  
\>  
Moira: Your honor, I found this memory catcher in the Night Brothers offices.  
Moira: I believe they used it to investigate the memories of those involved in this case.  
Moira: I'm sure you would agree it's only fair that we all see what they found.  
Racul: You may proceed, prosecutor.

Narrator: Moira plops the crystal ball on her table, wiping it with her hands.  
\*Play Sound s_transformation2  
Narrator: A grey cloud forms within the ball.  
Moira: This memory was found in a cat outside of Dracula's villa.  
Moira: Days before Mary's death, someone visited her.  
Narrator: The Memory Catcher swirls a purple cloud, revealing the same scene you've already seen.  
Narrator: Liam's shoes outside of Dracula's villa.  
Moira: That is Liam Night's feet, correct?  
Jerry: It would appear so.  
Moira: He visited Mary several days before her birth. For reason the Night Brothers have failed to explain.  
Jerry: It would seem the defendants have a special relationship with Mary.  
Jerry: And that would explain why Dracula would murder his wife and child.  
Moira: Special? Expand on that please, Doctor.  
Jerry: Well, violent outbursts are oftentimes justified.  
Jerry: Murderers often feel that their violence is only a reaction to being wronged.  
Narrator: Your blood boils up to your ears.  
Eve*Think(angry): I can't believe he's just sitting there talking about violence like it's nothing.  
Eve*Think(angry): After all of the abuse he put me through. He just smiles and chats like it's nothing.  
Eve*Think(sad): Should I say something?

## A. Yell and call Jerry out! (Cost: 17 Diamond ID: plot_iatw_13_jerry)  
## B. Stay quiet.  
#### A  
Eve(angry): Objection, your honor. I can't sit here in good conscience and let this go on.  
Eve(angry): This man is a domestic abuser. A violent narcissist.  
Eve(angry): He's a man incapable of understanding empathy or respect.  
Moira(happy): And how could you know such things, young one? Please do share.  
\>>  
Eve(sad): Because I Was in an intimate relationship with him for years.  
Eve(sad): And he abused me in that time in a manner you can only have nightmares of.  
Eve(angry): He has every reason to hide abusive behavior towards intimate partners.  
Eve(angry): And I have the scars to prove it.  
Moira(angry): Unsubstantiated accusations against my brother to smear his credentials won't work...  
Moira(angry): ... miss.  
Moira: Regardless of Dr. Van Helsings's personal life, you have no evidence to support that.  
Moira(angry): As such, it's seemingly irrelevant to whether or not Dracula murdered Mary and her child.  
Moira(angry): However, Dr. Van Helsing's professional expertise regarding violence is extremely relevant.  
\>  
Racul: The prosecutor is right, young one. Please. Be seated. And do not disturb like this again.  
Racul: Or I will be forced to hold you in contempt.  
Narrator: Frustrated, you plop back down into your seat.  
Eve*Think(sad): This is so unfair...  
#### B  
Eve*Think(sad): I shouldn't say anything. Calling him out will only make me look bad!  
\***  
Derek(angry): Hold on, Moira. You're saying that because Liam visited Mary days before her murder...  
Derek(angry): That Liam was having an affair with Mary, and that's why Dracula killed them?  
Derek(angry): Your honor, do I really need to explain how far of a reach that is?  
Derek(angry): Do you have any evidence to support these claims, Moira? Anything?  
Moira(happy): I suppose I don't.  
Narrator: All five of you stare at Moira with confusion as she just shrugs.  
Eve(sad): Oh God. I know what Moira's trying to do.  
\>>  
Sabastian(surprise): What?! Tell us, {Eve Name}.  
Eve(sad): Think about it. She doesn't need to prove Dracula murdered them.  
Eve(sad): She just needs to prove he's violent. Capable of murder...  
Narrator: And it hits the brothers at once. That it doesn't matter that Liam visited Mary.  
Narrator: But Dracula didn't know this.  
Eve(sad): Moira's not showing this to the jury. She's showing it to Dracula.

Narrator: And with that, everyone turns to Dracula. The man on trial.  
Narrator: The man whose life hangs in the balance.  
Narrator: And the man that just heard that Liam was sleeping with Mary.  
Narrator: Dracula's composure is gone. Now, the only fury in his eyes, he flips the stone table out of his way.

Narrator: Dath'Racul bellows fire into the air with a loud screech.  
Narrator: With one gust of his wings, Vlad flies off of Liam, smashing into the wall.  
Narrator: A powerful force from Dath'Racul's wing holds Vlad to the wall.  
\>>  
Derek(surprise): Liam, are you okay?  
Narrator: Liam struggles to rise, gripping his nearly ripped throat.  
Liam(angry): I'm fine.  
Eve*Think(sad): Liam wasn't even sleeping with Mary!  
Eve*Think(sad): He told us he was only helping her with the pregnancy.  
Eve*Think(sad): But he did mention he had feelings for her...  
Eve*Think(sad): God, what a disaster.  
\>  
Racul: Order in my court. Now.  
\*Camera Left 2  
Narrator: As silence finally falls, Moira takes advantage, approaching the jurors.  
Moira(happy): Jurors of this court, do you really need any more evidence that Dracula is violent?  
Moira: He can't even compose himself in this court of law.  
Moira(happy): Isn't it fair to assume that he would have an equally violent reaction...  
Moira(happy): ... to the news that Mary was having an affair?  
Narrator: The jurors whisper to each other, seemingly in agreement with Moira.  
Eve*Think(sad): We can't let Moira get away with this!  
# (iatw_13_10_explain_to_the_court)  
## A. Explain to the court what Liam was doing! (Cost: 20 Diamond ID: plot_iatw_13_explain)  
## B. Stay quiet.  
#### A  
\*Camera Middle 2  
Narrator: You step forward.  
Eve: Dath'Racul, please. If I may.  
Eve(angry): The defendants representing Dracula deserve to explain the correct perspective of situation.  
Racul: Please do.  
Eve: Liam Night visited Mary that day. We can confirm that the shoes are his.  
Narrator: You turn to Dracula, finally returning to his seat.  
\>>  
Eve(angry): But he was not there to sleep with Mary.  
Eve(sad): Nor does any of this prove that he was having an affair.  
Eve(angry): As you know, the Night Brothers are former Druids.  
Eve(angry): Before Dracula bit and turned them, they had the mystic powers of the elements.  
Eve(angry): One of those many powers is the ability to heal.  
Eve(sad): Mary asked Liam to visit her to help with her pregnancy.  
Eve(sad): She was having concerns about her baby and needed help.  
Eve(angry): There is no reason to believe their relationship was intimate in nature.  
Moira(angry): And how can we trust you? This Memory Catcher was used by your team.  
Moira(angry): And it was purposefully withheld from evidence in this case.  
Moira(angry): And if that's not bad enough...  
Moira(sad): Liam failed to present any of this information in our discovery process.  
\>  
Moira(sad): How much are you really hiding, Night Brothers?  
Derek(angry): This evidence was found during our investigation.  
Derek(angry): Liam's relationship with Mary, either as legal counselor or healer, does not impact her death.  
Liam(sad): And that is our memory catcher, your honor.  
Liam(angry): Perhaps the conversation of how Moira came across that Memory Catcher is worth having.  
Liam(sad): How much is a breaking and entering charge worth to you, prosecutor?  
Moira(happy): Ridiculous. This was simply handed to our team by an anonymous witness you will soon meet.  
Eve(sad): Regardless, this evidence proves nothing.  
Eve(sad): As for Dracula's outburst... I...  
Narrator: Elijah steps forward, saving you.  
Elijah: Dracula is under considerable stress and anxiety. His life hangs in the balance.  
Elijah: His violent reaction, while unwise, is only a response to the significant distress from this case.  
Elijah: As such, we should not believe that his violent outburst suggests he murdered his wife or child.  
Sabastian: Jurors, please understand Moira's manipulation of your emotions. This was a scheme. A game.  
Narrator: You eye the jurors, desperate to read their faces.  
Narrator: About half of them nod in agreement with Elijah, seemingly convinced.  
Narrator: A few others snarl at Moira, angry at her attempts to manipuate them.  
Eve*Think(happy): It worked! We're finally starting to get a few jurors on our side...  
Moira(angry): Ask yourself this, jurors. What if it were your loved one that Dracula killed?  
Moira(happy): Wouldn't that matter to you?  
Narrator: A few of them still side-eye Dracula, afraid he's going to tackle them next.

Sabastian(angry): Your honor, this news is just now brought to light.  
Sabastian: If we may have a fifteen-minute recess to gather our thoughts.  
Moira(angry): I don't believe that's necessary. I-  
Narrator: But the dragon snarls at Moira.  
Racul: You've been offered plenty of opportunities, Moira.  
Racul: I do believe a fifteen-minute recess is more than okay. Mind your place, Prosecutor.  
Moira: Of course. My apologies, your honor.  
Racul: Fifteen minutes. No more, Night Brothers.  
Narrator: And with that, the brothers hustle out of the courtroom, meeting out in the hall.

Elijah: Those jurors have to be convinced that Dracula is dangerous.
