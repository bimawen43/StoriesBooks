Narrator: You jump in your seat as the limo passes a bump on the road, but it continues smoothly coasting through the city.  
Narrator: You look to the back of Lily's head.  
Narrator: She hums a song as she drives along.  
Narrator: Across the spacious limo seating, Sabastian sits as far from you as possible.  
Narrator: Fortunately there's plenty of room.  
Narrator: But you can't help but feel your body craving to be a just a little bit closer to this insanely attractive man.  
Narrator: Still, your brain knows better as you clear your throat and gaze out the window.  
Narrator: Sabastian peers over at you, scanning your whole body with his eyes.  
\>>R  
Sabastian(happy): I hope you don't mind that I join you. We're both going to the same location, after all.

Eve(smile): This is your car and driver. I just appreciate the ride. And the job.  
Eve(smile): After all...  
Eve(happy): There are worse people to share a ride with.  
Eve(smile): I really don't mind being seen with you.  
\*Sabastian REL +1  
Sabastian(happy): Are you calling me attractive?  
Eve(smile): Come on, Sabastian. You and I both know you're easy on the eyes.  
Eve(smile): Modesty doesn't suit you.  
Sabastian(happy): Fair enough.  
Narrator: You slide closer to Sabastian, his cologne flaring your nostrils.  
Narrator: You soak in the mesmerizing perfume of oak and pine that falls from his body.  
Eve(happy): I've never been in a limo before.  
Sabastian: First time for everything.  
Eve(happy): You know, I'll always remember my first time.  
Eve(happy): Perhaps we should make it memorable?  
Narrator: Sabastian swivels his head your direction, raising an eyebrow.  
Narrator: He shakes his head.  
Sabastian: You never turn it off, do you?  
Eve(happy): You really want me to?  
Narrator: Considering your question, Sabastian finally smirks.  
Sabastian(happy): No. I don't.  
Eve(happy): I know you don't.  
Eve(happy): Ever since the subway. I see how you look at me.  
Eve(happy): Pretend not to look at me when I'm not looking at you.  
Sabastian(happy): I'm not the only one side-eyeing, dear.  
Sabastian(happy): Don't think I haven't caught you staring at me.  
Sabastian(happy): Staring at my backside when I'm looking away.  
Narrator: Your hand dances along his arm, squeezing his arm, as hard as marble.  
Eve(happy): Admiring how perfectly shaped it is.  
Eve(happy): You noticed?  
Eve(happy): Hard not to.  
Narrator: You feel your body lean forward, out of your control. Closer to him.  
Sabastian: Then perhaps we should be excused for where our eyes wander.  
Narrator: You can't help but notice his eyes dance downwards, scanning every inch of you.  
Narrator: Undressing you with his eyes, his mind likely filled with a million desires.  
Narrator: But your faces shoot away from each other as Lily pops in, killing the mood.  
Lily(happy): Still got some ways, boss man! We're hopping on the highway. Buckle up!  
Narrator: Sliding off, you scoot back to the opposite side of the limo, stretching your legs.  
#### B  
Eve(angry): If you can afford limos, I assume you have your own car.  
Eve(angry): I'd preferred you use that rather than bum my ride.

Sabastian(angry): Our ride, {Eve Name}. You may work for us, but you're not part of the family yet.  
\***  
Eve: So where are we going?  
Sabastian(smile): Wherever Lily is taking us, I suppose.  
Narrator: You roll your eyes at Sabastian's answer.  
Eve*Think(angry): I can't tell if he's being coy to be annoying or flirty.  
Lily(happy): We're headed home.  
Lily(happy): {Eve Name}, we're getting you comfortable with where you'll be working and living.  
Eve(confuse): What about all my stuff?  
Sabastian(smile): Our movers are already taking care of that. Your belongings will be moved to your room before sunrise.

Narrator: He sighs in exasperation and lowers the paper to glare at you.  
Sabastian(angry): I prefer analogue to digital. Call me old-fashioned.

Sabastian(angry): I don't do something your way so I'm lame?  
Eve(angry): I'm just saying... there's so much more information online than on that piece of paper.  
Sabastian(angry): Wrong information. Written by random know-it-alls.  
Sabastian(angry): None of the news online information is vetted. Researched. Making it unreliable.  
Sabastian(angry): I'd rather have some reliable information than a lot of unreliable information.  
Eve(angry): Whatever.

Eve(happy): All the nonsense online lately. Maybe it's worth falling back to the older ways of news.

Narrator: Lily giggles at Sabastian's comment, seemingly unintimidated by his presence.  
Lily(happy): Oh Uncle Sab, stop being such a brat.  
Eve*Think(surprise): I'm surprised to hear her teasing him like that! She must be really close with them!  
Narrator: Even more surprising, Sabastian's face lights up in a smile and he only laughs in return.  
Narrator: It's the first time you've heard him laugh.  
Narrator: It's deep and husky, only making his face that much more handsome.  
Narrator: But the moment passes, and he returns his focus to you.  
Eve: Look. I know you think I'm not serious about this job because of what I said on the subway.  
Eve: But I am.  
Eve*Think(sad): How do I convince him?

## B. Even though I'd rather be an artist.

Eve: If I had to worry about drawing for others, for money, I might not get the joy from it I do now.  
Eve: I meant what I said in the interview.  
Eve: I'm smart, educated, and resourceful.  
Eve: Granted I'm still not entirely sure what my job entails, but I can promise you I'm a quick learner.  
Eve: If you give me a chance, I'll prove to you that I'm an excellent employee.  
#### B  
Eve: Art will always be my passion. It's part of me. Who I am.  
Eve: But that doesn't mean I don't have the intelligence and resources to do this job well.  
Eve: And if you give me a chance, I'll prove to you that I'm an excellent employee.

Eve(happy): Good.  
Narrator: You slump into your seat, emotionally spent.  
Narrator: Sabastian seems to notice, as he puts away the newspaper and hands you a champagne glass.

Narrator: The earthy tones of pine and oak hit your nostrils.  
Narrator: Your knees would buckle if you weren't already sitting down.  
Narrator: He pulls out a bottle of champagne that's been chilling in ice in a corner that you hadn't noticed.

Narrator: His skin is soft, gently wrapping around the neck of the bottle.  
Narrator: A stop drip of condensation trickles along with his hand, landing on the cuff of his suit.  
Narrator: You toast and take a sip.  
Narrator: The bubbles tickle your mouth as you swallow.  
Narrator: You watch Sabastian drink. You can't help but feel your bubbles with his. The same sensation. The same moment.  
Narrator: In some strange way, it almost feels like a distant kiss. But only because your mind's insisting to imagine that.

Eve(sad): But... he couldn't handle the impact his cancer had on him. On me.  
Eve(sad): He blamed himself for everything we've lost.  
Eve(cry): He committed suicide.  
Sabastian(sad): Oh.  
Narrator: A twinge of pain hits Sabastian as his face curls to sadness. You lock eyes, feeling his emotions with yours.  
Sabastian(sad): I'm so sorry.  
Eve(cry): I never got over it. Still haven't.  
Eve(cry): The depression. I couldn't go to work. Couldn't focus on... anything, really.  
Eve(sad): Eventually my job couldn't keep me. I was dead weight to them. I was fired.  
Eve(sad): And I just... haven't been able to come back since.

Sabastian(sad): Only alleviated by the love of someone else.

Sabastian(angry): A powerful creature. One even stronger than me and my brothers.  
Sabastian(angry): I will need to discuss this with my brothers.  
Sabastian(angry): But...  
#### C  
Eve(sad): I mean... what we're looking at isn't possible.  
Sabastian(happy): Not possible in your world, {Eve Name}.  
Sabastian(happy): Working for us...  
Sabastian(happy): You will quickly learn that you will need to re-evaluate what is possible and what isn't.  
Narrator: Sabastian turns back to the smashed limo.  
\***  
\>>  
Sabastian(angry): I think I know who it was.  
Sabastian(angry): Like we said before. We have a dangerous job. Full of dangerous people.  
Eve(sad): Yeah but... people that want to kill you?!  
\>>>  
Sabastian(angry): They didn't want to kill me. Or Lily.  
Sabastian(angry): They knew a crash like this wouldn't be enough to kill us.  
Sabastian(sad): They were trying to kill you, {Eve Name}.

Eve(sad): {*Joyful Kill me?! Why?!}  
Sabastian(sad): The case we're working on is high profile to say the least.  
Sabastian(sad): Our enemies know any help we get is one step closer to winning this case.  
Sabastian(sad): I'm sorry you're involved in this horrible violence.  
Eve*Think(sad): Am I okay with this?  
# (iatw_04_10_horrible violence)  
## A. I can handle this! (Cost: 17 Diamond ID: plot_iatw_04n_brave)  
## B. This is horrible.  
#### A  
Eve(sad): This is what I signed up for.  
Eve(sad): I knew the risks of getting involved with people like yourself.  
Eve(sad): Well... whatever you all are.  
Narrator: Sabastian pauses as you see him lost for words for the first time ever.  
Eve(angry): What?  
Sabastian(happy): Nothing, I just... I've never known a human to be so resilient. So strong.  
\*Sabastian REL +1  
Sabastian(happy): Grandmother Matilda may be right about you, after all.  
Eve: What do you mean?  
Sabastian(happy): Perhaps you are more special than any of us have even realized yet.  
Eve(sad): Well I don't know what to say to that. I'm not special.  
Sabastian(sad): Yes you are. It took me until this moment to realize that you are. To me, at least.  
Narrator: Sabastian leans close, gently kissing you on the forehead.  
Narrator: Closing your eyes, you feel his soft lips softly collapse onto your forehead, sending electricity throughout your body.  
Narrator: You can't help but lean into his kiss, then his body.  
Narrator: He wraps his arm around you, comforting you.  
Narrator: And just like that all of the pain escapes you.  
Narrator: The adrenaline. Pain. Anxiety.  
Narrator: All of it vanishes in a second with his embrace.  
Narrator: Replaced with an emotion unfamiliar. Powerful, but lovingly warm.  
Narrator: Something you've never felt before. But something you've always needed.  
Narrator: Without words to describe it, you only lean in close to Sabastian, embracing him for a beautifully tragic moment.  
#### B  
Eve(angry): I agreed to a job. Not this.  
Eve(angry): I want out. I can't handle this.  
Eve(angry): You're obviously indestructible. I'm not.  
Sabastian(sad): I'm not. And whether you want to be or not, you're involved in this.  
Sabastian(sad): You can't back out now. I'm sorry.  
\***

Narrator: Suddenly, a van screeches up to you and Sabastian.  
\*Play Sound s_pull_up  
Narrator: The front window rolls down, revealing Lily.  
Lily(sad): Get in! Hurry! The house is only a minute or two away. We need to go!  
Narrator: As Sabastian tosses you into the van, you can't help but notice Lily is also entirely unhurt.

Narrator: After a short few minutes of a car ride, you finally arrive at your new home.  
Narrator: The van quickly pulls up. Lily is the first to burst open the front doors of the mansion.  
Narrator: The magical ooze has clearly done its trick, your leg already strong enough to walk on.  
Narrator: You slowly limp into the lobby of the mansion, immediately struck by its beauty.  
Narrator: The mansion is huge.  
Narrator: Outside, the mansion is hidden deep in the middle of the country.  
Narrator: Surrounding the land is an ocean on one side and forest on the other.

Eve(happy): Had I known this is what you're all workin' with, I would have accepted the position earlier!

Narrator: Close to the front door of the lobby is a pond big enough to be a moat.  
Narrator: Koi splash in the water, happily exploring their own little world.  
Narrator: As you step into the lobby, you're immediately greeted by some familiar faces.  
Narrator: The three other brothers rush up to Sabastian as he helps you limp into the mansion.  
Narrator: But it's Grandmother Matilda that rushes to you first.  
Matilda(surprise): Oh my goodness! {Eve Name}! Are you okay?  
Eve*Think(sad): I'm not sure how to answer that...

Derek(surprise): What happened?!  
Liam(angry): Who did this?!  
Elijah(surprise): We just got the call from Lily. We were about to drive over ourselves.  
\>>  
Sabastian(angry): We were attacked. Someone stepped into the street.  
Lily(sad): He hopped right in front of the car. Only a split second before the limo hit him.  
Lily(sad): I... I didn't have time to swerve out of the way.  
\>  
Derek(sad): Did you get a look at who it was?  
Narrator: Lily shakes her head in shame.  
Lily(sad): I'm so sorry.  
Derek(smile): Hey. It's okay. It's not your fault.  
Narrator: Derek wraps his arms around Lily, holding her.  
Elijah(happy): You were smart, Lily. Got the van in seconds. Got them both back here in minutes.  
Elijah(smile): You did everything right. Nothing to apologize for.  
Liam(angry): The person responsible is whoever tried to kill {Eve Name}.  
Liam(angry): They're the ones responsible. We'll put them to justice.  
Eve(sad): Any idea who it was?

Derek(smile): Especially after what happened.  
Sabastian(happy): Let the elixir do its magic.  
Sabastian(smile): It will help heal all of the wounds you've suffered within a few hours.  
Narrator: As the brothers leave, they immediately begin speaking about who attacked the limo.  
Narrator: Your ears perk, trying your best to eavesdrop their conversation.  
Narrator: But you're only able to make out one name.  
Narrator: Van Helsing.

# (iatw_04_13_first_day_job)  
## A. Not what I signed up for.  
## B. Not that bad.  
## C. Exciting!  
#### A

Lily(happy): It's not a common thing, I swear. Our world has always been dangerous.  
Lily(happy): You'll get used to it.  
#### B  
Eve(happy): I've had worse first days on the job, to be honest.  
Lily: I can't imagine.  
Eve(happy): You've never worked retail.  
Narrator: You both laugh.  
#### C  
Eve(happy): I've needed something new in my life. Especially after everything going on with my brother.  
Eve(happy): As crazy as it sounds, everything that happened just makes me feel... excited.  
Eve(happy): I can't wait to see what happens next!  
Lily(happy): I knew you'd be perfect for this job.
