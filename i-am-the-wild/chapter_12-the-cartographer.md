Narrator: It's a short ride from Lilth's palace to the cartographer.  
Narrator: The trip is quiet. Elijah studies paperwork in silence as you fidget in your seat.  
Eve(happy)*Think: He was so talkative before. But he gets so quiet when he works!  
Eve(happy): When will we get to the cartographer to analyze these love letters?  
Narrator: Elijah finally pulls away from his paperwork, beaming you with his bright eyes.  
Narrator: He smiles, as if the sight of you brings him comfort.  
Elijah(smile): Soon. She's... quite the peculiar being. But she lives close.  
Narrator: And the second his words disappear into the air, he returns to his paperwork.  
Narrator: You nod something lost on him, returning your eyes outside.  
Narrator: A deep sigh soothes the ache in your chest as you stretch your neck.  
Elijah(happy): We're here. The cartographer's house.  
Elijah: Let's hope we can find some answers here.

Narrator: Your feet press into the soft, woven bamboo floor as you gaze at the walls.

Narrator: Wrapped around her skinny frame is a kimono, a color of red so deep it looks like blood.  
Narrator: A pendant of a crystal ball hangs on her neck, a swirling cloud inside.  
Narrator: Her glossy black hair is expertly wrapped around her head.  
Narrator: But it's her fox ears you can't stop staring at.  
Eve(surprise): You... your ears...  
Kana(smile): I use it for listening.  
Elijah(happy): She's a kitsune, {Eve Name}. She can turn into a fox.  
Narrator: Her fox ears twitch at the sight of Elijah, perking her attention.  
\>>  
Kana(smile): Elijah Night.  
Kana(smile): I saw you. Riding here in your magical carriage.  
Kana: I saw you drinking your nightly goblet of blood.  
Kana: I saw you before you even woke up tonight.  
Elijah(happy): I imagined so.  
Elijah: I hope we aren't intruding, Kana.  
Kana(smile): That is impossible with me, Mr. Night. You know this.

Eve(surprise): Wait... what's going on? Why is that impossible?

Elijah: She's clairvoyant, {Eve Name}.

# (iatw_12_03_clairvoyant)  
## A. Dispute it.

## C. Ask her about the powers.  
#### A  
Narrator: You open your mouth to speak, but Kana waves her hand, stopping you.  
Kana(smile): You're going to dispute the claim that I'm clairvoyant.  
Kana(smile): I can assure you it is pointless.  
#### B  
Narrator: You open your mouth to speak, but Kana waves her hand, stopping you.  
Kana: You're about to accept the fact that I'm clairvoyant.  
Kana(smile): I'm happy to hear you can be so trusting.  
#### C  
Narrator: You open your mouth to speak, but Kana waves her hand, stopping you.  
Kana(smile): You're about to ask me about my powers. I already know.  
Kana: But let us not waste time. You are in need of my services.  
Kana(smile): My knowledge that your trip here is of dire importance further serves as the evidence you need.  
Eve(surprise): I... I guess it does.  
\***  
Kana(smile): I'm afraid I already envisioned this conversation.  
Kana(smile): As I said before... I saw you before you even stepped foot in my house.  
Narrator: She moves about her house like water. Her hips sway with elegance as she approaches you.  
Narrator: Her palm collapses onto Elijah's shoulder, caressing him in a manner uneasy to you.  
Kana(smile): The love letters, please.  
Narrator: Elijah smirks with his realization that he can't hide anything from her.  
Narrator: Burying into his breast pocket, he pulls out the love letters, handing them to Kana.  
Elijah: These were found in Mary's room. Where she was found murdered.  
Elijah: We need to know who wrote them. Or when they were written.  
Eve: To be honest, anything you can tell us would be appreciated.  
Kana: Fascinating.  
Narrator: Cradling the letters like fragile birds, she caresses the soft fabric of the paper.  
Narrator: She motions to the table with her hand.  
Kana: Please.  
Narrator: You and Elijah join her at the table, kneeling on the soft cushions.  
Kana(smile): Before I begin... Elijah. Do you have my payment?  
Narrator: Elijah nods, reaching into his breast pocket again.  
Narrator: Except this time he pulls out a small vial of blood, handing it to Kana.  
Narrator: She slips the vial into her kimono.

Eve(surprise): Whose blood is that?  
Elijah(happy): Mine.  
Kana(smile): While not as rare as unicorn blood, vampire blood is still valuable.  
Kana(smile): The more complicated potions and spells require it.  
Elijah(sad): Just no love potions, please.  
Elijah(sad): I'd hate to think my blood is used against some pour soul's consent.  
\>  
Kana: Of course not, Elijah. I'm not a monster.  
Narrator: Kana lines the letters along the table.  
Eve*Think(surprise): Kana seems to have a lot of magic. How exactly is she going to read the letters?

## C. Keep quiet.  
#### A  
Kana: The magic I possess is nearly impossible to verbalize.  
Kana(smile): As such, I don't believe I will waste our time attempting to explain it.  
Kana(smile): Just know I will use my abilities to investigate these letters in ways incomprehensible to you.  
Eve(sad): Alright... I'll try my best not to think about it.  
#### B  
Eve(angry): We need those for court. They're considered as evidence in the case.  
Kana(smile): Worry not, young one. I'll be careful. I promise.

Kana: The author is old. Powerful. Ancient. And dangerous.  
Kana(sad): I am say to inform you I am unable to give you a name.  
Kana: But the author is dangerous. That I know of for sure.  
Eve: What other man could Mary have been in contact with?  
Eve: I know he says otherwise, but I still think Liam could have written them.  
Elijah: Maybe the butler. Leonard.  
Kana(smile): Oh you lovely vampire, you. Your logic has an inherent flaw.

Narrator: You turn and walk out. But outside you can hear her burst into tears the second you leave.  
#### B  
Eve(happy): Just saying hello. That's all.  
Lilith: Very well. Hello.  
Lilith: I assume you should return to the Night mansion. Clock is ticking for my late husband, no?  
Eve: I suppose so.  
Lilith: Be gone. We will see each other in court.  
Lilith: The Van Helsings have a subpoena with my name on it.  
Lilith: I will be forced to speak on Dracula with honesty.  
Eve(sad): I hope you are willing to help us. Tell the prosecutors that Dracula didn't kill Mary.  
Lilith(happy): I suppose you will need to wait and find out.  
Eve(angry): Fine.  
Narrator: Turning on your heels, you leave the mansion.

Narrator: Stepping into the ballroom of the Night mansion, you find the other brothers huddled together.  
Sabastian(happy): {Eve Name}! You're back. Did you have fun meeting Kana?  
Derek(happy): Hopefully not too much fun with Elijah.  
Eve(happy): She's a character, to say the least. We found a few things out, but not much.  
Derek: You and Elijah will need to catch us up on the way to court.  
\>>  
Eve(surprise): Court? Why are we going there?  
Liam(angry): We're out of time. The trial is beginning.  
Eve(angry): Already?! We didn't have enough time!  
Derek(angry): Moira Van Helsing's brother requested a rushed trial. It was granted by the dragon.  
Elijah(angry): That skeevy little twerp.  
Eve(sad): I didn't even know Moira Van Helsing had a brother.  
Liam(angry): He's a pompous fool.  
Eve(sad): Well we need to get going. Use what we have.  
\>  
Elijah: We don't have much of anything.  
Derek: The only thing we have less than evidence is time.  
Derek: Let's get changed and head to court.  
Derek: Elijah and {Eve Name} will catch us up on the way there.

Narrator: But the pedestrians are anything but.  
Narrator: You walk alongside the brothers, barely able to keep up with their long strides.  
Narrator: Your eyes dance upon each creature you see. Centaurs arguing. Families of fairies crying.  
Narrator: Two workers slide a massive fishbowl past you with a handcuffed mermaid inside.  
Narrator: She snarls her jagged teeth at you as she's whisked past you.  
Narrator: Sabastian moves close to you.  
Sabastian(happy): First time in court?  
Eve(happy): In your world, yeah.  
Eve(happy): It looks... pretty identical to courts in my world.  
Elijah(happy): Our world based the architecture of the courthouse from yours. Cold and objective.  
Derek(happy): Those aren't the only inspiration. Our entire legal system was designed around yours.

Liam: Humans may be mortal bags of blood, but they know how to build ethics systems for society.

Narrator: Nailed to the wall beside the door is a sign, reading "Courtroom 6".  
Sabastian: This is us.  
Narrator: Sabastian turns to you. The brothers adjust their tailored suits and perfect hair in unison.  
Sabastian: {Eve Name}. Are you ready?  
Narrator: You gulp what feels like a marble stuck in your throat as your stomach turns.  
Eve*Think(sad): My first court case and Dracula's life hangs in the balance!  
Eve*Think(sad): And if we lose the Night Brothers reputation is ruined.
