Narrator: Your spine tingles, causing a shiver down your whole body.  
Narrator: You walk through the various hallways of this vast, mysterious mansion owned by The Night brothers.  
Narrator: Shuffling beside you is Matilda, their grandmother, as she shows you to your new room.  
Narrator: The interior of the mansion takes your breath away as you absorb its flawless designs.  
Narrator: The entryway is bigger than some apartments in the city.  
Narrator: Every window is draped with beautiful silk curtains. Every bit of furniture looks like an antique.

Narrator: Grand staircases wind up to multiple floors.

Eve(surprise): Yeah, what was that weird green goo, anyway?  
Eve(surprise): And how did Sabastian rip off that car door like it was made out of aluminum foil?

Narrator: Another has wooden lines that swirl, almost resembling water.  
Narrator: Next to that one is a coffin made of growing wood, with greenery and pine growing out.  
Narrator: And the final coffin on the edge is the strangest.  
Narrator: It's patterned with a more complicated swirling pattern that reminds you of air.  
Eve(happy): Okay, spill it. What's going on?

Sabastian(happy): You see, {Eve Name}. We are more than just vampires.  
Sabastian(happy): Before we were turned into such creatures, we were powerful druids.  
Sabastian(happy): Our births were representative of each of the world's most powerful forces.  
Narrator: You point to each coffin in order.  
\>>  
Eve(happy): Let me guess. Fire, Water, Earth, and Air?  
Sabastian(happy): Yes, that's correct.  
Narrator: He approaches the coffin with the greenery and growing branches.  
Eve(happy): That's yours? You're the earth druid?  
Sabastian(happy): Yes.  
Narrator: And suddenly something in your mind clicks.  
Narrator: When you first sketched him on that subway.  
Narrator: The mountain you drew behind him that you assumed was just a creative spark.  
Eve*Think(surprise): His stubbornness and inflexibility.  
Eve*Think(surprise): That must be part of his elemental trait!  
\>  
Eve(happy): So you were all magical, ancient druids. Then turned into vampires?  
Sabastian(happy): And we possess abilities unique to our elements. Powers beyond that of a vampire.  
Eve(surprise): Wait, what kind of vampire can turn druids?  
Sabastian(happy): Only the most powerful one.  
Eve(surprise): Wow.

Eve(happy): Let me guess. Fire, Water, Earth, and Air?  
Elijah(happy): Yes, that's correct.  
Narrator: He approaches the coffin at the end, with the detailed swirls that look like gusts of air.  
Eve(surprise): That's your coffin? You're the air druid?  
Elijah(happy): Yes.  
Narrator: Derek clears his throat, chiming in.  
Derek(happy): As you will come to realize, Elijah is the intellectual. The thinker.  
Eve(happy): Always with a new idea or concept.  
\>  
Eve(surprise): I can see how the air druid would be like that.  
Eve(happy): So you were all magical, ancient druids. Then turned into vampires?

Narrator: Derek closes and locks the door to the room full of their secrets.  
Narrator: You shake your head at the brothers, a smirk on your face.  
Eve(happy): You guys clearly take this whole vampire thing seriously.  
Eve(happy): You know, there are a lot of girls out there that'd pay good money for this kind of stuff.  
Eve(happy): You're all some kinky folks, huh?

Liam(angry): Stop joking around, girl. This is serious.  
Eve(happy): No I get it. You're all vampires. You do you.

Narrator: You show your teeth.  
Eve(happy): No bitey on me and we're all good.  
Narrator: Sabastian throws his hands in the air and turns away, sighing.  
Narrator: Elijah presses his lips together, and Derek frowns.  
Narrator: But not Liam. He's been bubbling with contempt since the start, and he clearly boils over.  
Narrator: What happens next is too fast for you to do anything to prevent it.

## A. Kick him off!  
## B. Beg him to stop.  
## C. Let him drain you.  
#### A  
Narrator: With every ounce of fight you have, you swing your leg at Liam to kick whatever your leg connects with.  
Narrator: But your foot only hits his thigh.  
Narrator: With muscles like they're carved from marble, he barely registers the useless kick.  
#### B  
Eve*Shout(sad): Please! Stop it! I was just kidding!  
Narrator: But your pleads for mercy are useless.  
#### C  
Narrator: Closing your eyes, you give in to the moment.

Narrator: Your eyes roll as you finally pass out.
