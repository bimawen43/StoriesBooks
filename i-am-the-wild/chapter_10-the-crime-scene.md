Narrator: You step inside the coroner's office.  
Narrator: Overhead lights reveal a tile floor, medical supplies, and rows of dead bodies trapped like cubbies.  
Narrator: You breathe in a sting of bleach and other industrial grade cleaners.  
Narrator: Your body shivers to the cold temperature that's required to keep the dead bodies stale.  
\>>  
Eve*Think(surprise): This is exactly how a coroner's office looks on Earth!  
Eve*Think(happy): I suppose death is the same, no matter what creature you are.  
Eve*Think(sad): Cold and indifferent.  
Sabastian: Elal! Ifi! Are you here?  
\>  
Eve(confuse): Who are you talking to?  
Narrator: And in that moment, a burst of flames explodes out from the door opposite to you both.  
Eve(surprise)*Shout: Agh!  
Narrator: You flail your arms up in defense, but Sabastian doesn't flinch.  
Eve(surprise): What is that?  
\>>  
Sabastian(happy): Elal and Ifi. The coroners.  
Narrator: You stare at the large flame, separating into two human-like forms.  
Eve(surprise): Oh my God! Those two men are on fire!  
Narrator: But as you squint for a better look, you realize they aren't on fire.  
Narrator: They are fire.  
Narrator: Eventually the fire fades, revealing two handsome men.  
Narrator: A bead of sweat drops to your brow, either from the flames or the three handsome men in the room.  
Elal(happy): Oh, how rude of us! My name is Elal.  
Narrator: He chuckles, waving his hand.  
Elal(smile): This is my partner, Ifi.  
Elal(happy): Ifi, be a dear and cool off. The human is clearly uncomfortable.  
Narrator: The other flame reverts back to human as well, wrapping his arm around Elal.  
Ifi(smile): A human? Honey, we both know she's going to be uncomfortable with us no matter what.  
\>  
Elal: Not that such a thing would stop us from being who we are, no?  
Narrator: The two men hug, kissing each other with love.  
Narrator: Sabastian leans in close.  
Sabastian: They're a couple. I assume that's not a problem for you?  
Sabastian: I know you humans sometimes have a problem with whom you love.  
\>>  
Eve(surprise): Do I have a problem with them?

## A. I have no problem with that.  
## B. I have a problem with that.  
## C. None of your business.  
#### A  
Eve(smile): You should be able to love whomever you want!  
Elal(happy): Couldn't agree with you more, human.  
Ifi(smile): Glad we've got one of the good ones here.  
#### B  
Eve(angry): Do whatever you want in your spare time, but you're at work.  
Eve(angry): Besides, not everyone needs to agree with that kind of behavior.  
Eve(angry): Back on Earth we have rules for a reason. It's unnatural.  
Elal(angry): Whatever you want to believe, human.  
#### C  
Eve(angry): I'm allowed to believe whatever I want. This is work not personal.  
Sabastian: Very well.  
\***  
Eve(surprise): So you're the coroners? You... you're made of fire?  
Sabastian(happy): Elal and Ifi are Ifrits. Born of the flames.  
Sabastian(smile): They've been the coroners of this world since I've lived here.  
Sabastian(happy): Their flames are handy for the cremation of our bodies.

Elal(happy): And who is this lovely creature?  
Eve(smile): {Eve Name}. I work for The Night Firm now.  
Ifi(smile): Lovely to meet you, dear.  
Elal(happy): What can we do for you, Mr. Night?  
Sabastian: We're here on a case.  
Elal(happy): Well aren't you a busy little bee!  
Narrator: The two men dance around the room, approaching the rows of dead bodies.  
Elal(happy): Here for the recent werewolf murders?  
Narrator: He swings open one of the metal boxes, sliding out a mangled body of blood and gore.  
Ifi(happy): We've gotten more and more recently. Dragons are really going to have to punish them for this.  
Elal(happy): Oh! Or maybe you're here for all those witches?  
Narrator: Elal snaps that body shut and opens another cubicle.  
Elal(smile): I could have told them not to play with such black magic.  
Ifi(happy): Gruesome stuff. Probably about 15 of those poor girls died.  
Elal(smile): Let's see, we've also got-  
Sabastian(angry): -No. I'm here for Mary. Dracula's wife.  
Narrator: Those words silence Elal and Ifi, killing the joyful mood they carry.  
Elal(sad): The big one, huh? Well you're here on serious business, aren't you?  
Narrator: Ifi hovers over to the closest metal box and slides it open.  
Narrator: Inside, the dead body is covered by a white linen blanket.  
Narrator: But even under the blanket, you can make out the body of a woman.  
Sabastian: Tell us everything you know from the coroner's report.  
Elal: Not much, unfortunately.  
Narrator: Elal snaps his fingers, a small flame washing over his hand turning into a clipboard.  
Narrator: The two Ifrits step close to you.

Elal: The child was killed first. Mary was forced to watch, unfortunately.  
Ifi: Eek, poor girl.  
Elal: The child's head was ripped off. Its blood drained. Then Mary was drained and left for dead.  
Narrator: Your eyebrows shoot up.  
Eve: So the killer might have left before she died?  
Ifi: I suppose. Or the killer watched her die slowly.  
Elal: But we do know the creature didn't drain her completely.  
Sabastian: You said creature. It wasn't necessarily a vampire?  
Elal(happy): Come on, honey. You mean if Dracula did it?  
Narrator: Relenting, Sabastian nods his head.  
Narrator: Both Elal and Ifi purse their lips, shaking their heads.  
Ifi: Ehh, even that we're not sure. A vampire would be the most likely culprit since they were drained.  
Ifi: But there are some unusual inconsistencies. Her body still had a decent amount of blood left.  
Elal: A vampire like Dracula would drain every last drop.  
Ifi: Plus the bite wounds look more like... slashes.  
\>>>  
Elal: Yep. Almost like... claws.  
Ifi: Claws trying to make it look like puncture wounds.  
Eve(surprise): So it's entirely possible that someone was making this look like Dracula!  
\>>  
Sabastian: Possibly. Anything else?  
\>  
Narrator: Elal shakes his head no, but Ifi only looks at his lover, like there's something else.  
Elal: Sorry we couldn't be more helpful.  
Narrator: Sabastian turns around.  
Sabastian: Very well. Let us know if there is.  
Narrator: You and Sabastian turn towards the door, but Ifi stops you.  
Ifi: Sabastian! Wait! There is something else...  
Narrator: You both turn around.  
Elal(surprise): Sweetie, what are you talking about?  
Ifi(sad): Elal, the rumors. The test. We should tell them.  
Elal(angry): They're in the middle of a legal case!  
Elal(angry): They need not hear of silly rumors.  
Eve(surprise): What rumors?!  
Elal(angry): It's nothing. Be on your way.  
Ifi(angry): It's not nothing! For all we know it's true!  
\>>  
Sabastian(angry): What are you talking about?! Tell us at once!  
Narrator: A low growl in Sabastian's voice terrifies the two coroners.  
Narrator: Elal sighs, nodding his head your way at Ifi to spill the beans.  
Ifi: Well... We've been hearing these rumors lately about Mary.  
Ifi(happy): And honey, you know that I'm a sucker for some juicy gossip.  
Eve(surprise): What rumors?!  
Elal: That Mary had another lover.  
Ifi: And well... one night... after a few bottles of wine... Elal and I got a bit curious.  
Ifi: So we tested the body of the child.  
Sabastian: And?  
Narrator: The two lovers look at each other.  
\>>>  
Elal: The child did not belong to Dracula. The father was someone else.  
Eve(surprise): What?! Are you serious?  
Sabastian(surprise): Who's the father?!  
\>>  
Ifi: We don't know. We'd need to test them to know.  
Elal: All we know is that it's not Dracula.  
Sabastian(surprise): So Mary had another lover...  
Eve(surprise): And Dracula had no idea... But if he found out...  
Sabastian(surprise): He would kill Mary and the baby. Maybe he's not as innocent as he tells us...  
\>  
Sabastian: {Eve Name}, we need to continue our investigation.  
Narrator: The two Ifrits bow their heads, smiling your way.  
Elal(happy): Good to meet you, {Eve Name}.  
Narrator: And with that, you and Sabastian leave, returning to the carriage.

Narrator: Your eyes wander to Sabastian. He too is deep in thought.

Eve*Think(surprise): What should I ask?  
# (iatw_10_02_question)  
## A. Ask about Mary's baby and the gargoyle. (Cost: 18 Diamond ID: plot_iatw_10_question)  
## B. Stay quiet.  
#### A  
Eve: Okay, I gotta know...  
Eve: If what Elal and Ifi were saying were true...  
Eve: That means Mary was having an affair with Dracula, right?  
Sabastian: That would appear so.  
Eve(sad): Any idea who might be this home wrecker?  
Sabastian: Sleeping with Dracula's wife behind his back? Fathering a child that Dracula thinks is his?  
\>>  
Sabastian: Is it even possible to have that much courage?  
Eve: Maybe it's not courage. Maybe it's foolishness.  
Sabastian: True.  
Eve(angry): And what was up with Akuro? That gargoyle?  
Eve(surprise): Why was it saying I was more than human?  
Sabastian: To be honest, I'm not sure. It's possible that Akuro speaks the truth.  
Sabastian: It isn't unusual for non-humans to live on Earth without realizing it.  
Sabastian: And gargoyles are rarely wrong about these kinds of things.  
Sabastian(smile): If you were to have visions... flashing images coming and going...  
Sabastian(smile): It's possible you would have the gift of vision.  
\>>>R  
Eve(surprise): Vision?! Like I can tell the future?  
Sabastian(smile): Perhaps. It's more common than you think.  
\>>R  
Eve(sad): Well I have visions all the time. But I assumed they were part of my panic attacks.  
Sabastian(happy): They're often confused to be as such.  
Sabastian(happy): It is worth considering the possibility that you're more than human, {Eve Name}.  
Sabastian(happy): After all, you've found us.  
Eve(sad): This is crazy, right? You're seriously saying I'm not human?  
Narrator: A small smirk falls on Sabastian's face as he stares deep into your eyes.  
Eve(angry): What's so funny?  
Sabastian(smile): Nothing, I just...  
Sabastian(happy): Look around you, {Eve Name}. All the magic and fantasy in our world.  
Sabastian(happy): Is it really so crazy to believe that you belong here?  
Sabastian(smile): That you were always meant for this world?  
Narrator: He holds your hand, his face close to yours.  
Narrator: You can feel the warmth of his breath dance along your cheeks.  
Narrator: Your vision goes blurry, his presence nearly more than you can handle.  
Sabastian(happy): I feel something when I'm around you. Something I don't understand.  
Sabastian(smile): But I like it. I need more of it.  
Narrator: Your faces inch closer, as if fate is pushing you together.  
Sabastian(happy): So I don't doubt for a second that you're more than human.  
Sabastian(smile): That you're special. Because to me, you are.  
Eve(happy): Well... I appreciate that.  
Narrator: Your lip quivers, only inches from his. You want to close your eyes but you're lost in his.  
Narrator: Finally, he pulls away, sobering the moment into reality.  
Narrator: You pull away too, barely able to catch your breath. A warmth inside of you burns for him.  
#### B  
Eve*Think: Whatever. I have enough to worry about.  
\***  
Eve: So we went to the coroner. Where to next?  
Sabastian: The crime scene where Mary was killed. Dracula's villa.  
Eve: Will he be there?  
Narrator: Sabastian shakes his head, his gaze still fixed out the window.  
Sabastian: Not since Mary's murder.  
Sabastian: He's too love-stricken to go back. He's been staying at one of his other mansions.  
Sabastian: It's still an active crime scene, so he's not allowed there anyway.  
Narrator: The carriage slides through a flat dirt road.  
Narrator: As you peek out the window, your eyes are met with a vast meadow of purple grass.  
Narrator: Peppering the meadow are handfuls of towns.  
Narrator: From even this distance, you can make out various creatures in the cities.  
Narrator: Witches. Centaurs. Ogres. They walk along the streets through night markets lit by fire.  
Sabastian: Dracula's villa is at the top of a hill, above these cities.  
Sabastian: He built it away from the rest of civilization. Dracula says he prefers to be alone.  
Sabastian: But I suspect it's the townsfolk that prefer the distance from Dracula.  
Sabastian: The creatures too courageous to fear him only loathe him as a monster.  
Sabastian: Regardless, he's not liked by anyone.  
Eve: I think...  
# (iatw_10_03_not_like_by_anyone)  
## A. I like him.  
## B. I can see why. I don't like him.  
## C. I don't know how I feel about him.  
#### A  
Eve(happy): I mean he's a weird guy for sure.  
Eve(happy): But he seems harmless to me.  
Sabastian(happy): Nobody said you didn't have courage, {Eve Name}. That's for sure.  
#### B  
Eve(angry): I'm still not convinced he killed Mary and the child.  
Sabastian(angry): Neither am I, unfortunately.  
#### C  
Eve(sad): He's so... mysterious. I just can't get a sense of him.  
\***  
Narrator: The carriage finally comes to a stop.  
Lily(happy): We're here! Have fun you two.  
Lily(happy): Stay outta trouble, now.

Sabastian(sad): Tracks?  
Eve: It's an expression. He's rich.

Sabastian: Vampires get very good at acquiring wealth.  
Eve(happy): I assume that applies to you as well?

Narrator: Their Italian suits, all perfectly tailored to their muscles as hard as granite.  
Narrator: Sabastian, never one to be modest, simply smirks with a nod.  
Sabastian(happy): Yes.  
Eve: Then why work as lawyers? You could just retire on your wealth, couldn't you?  
\>  
Sabastian: We could. But even vampires need a purpose. Being immortal is a long time to live.  
Sabastian: For our lives to have meaning, we need work that fulfills us and makes a difference.  
Eve(smile): But why law, specifically?  
Sabastian: The paranormal legal system can be finicky. Dragons act as judges in our world.  
Sabastian: They are generally decent judges for the most part since they are wise and long-lived.  
Sabastian(sad): But their perspective can become skewed as a result and they can be overly harsh in their judgements.  
Sabastian: It's our job to make sure our clients get a fair trial.  
Sabastian: They aren't unnecessarily punished beyond what is reasonable for the crime they committed.  
Sabastian: Or if they're innocent, that they are not punished at all.  
\>>  
Eve(surprise): Do you believe Dracula is innocent?  
Narrator: Sabastian shrugs.  
Sabastian: I don't know.  
Sabastian: I don't think he would kill Mary.  
Sabastian(sad): But then again, I can't be sure I'm being impartial when it comes to him.  
Sabastian(sad): As I'm sure you've gathered, our history with him is complicated.  
Eve(angry): Yeah that's pretty clear.  
Sabastian: Anyway... that's why my brothers and I are lawyers. Because we want to help others.

Sabastian: But it may provide us with some useful information.  
Eve: I remember learning in those books in the library that Memory Catches can be tampered with.  
\>>  
Eve: How will we know his memory hasn't been changed by whomever did this?  
Sabastian: Vampires have adapted to be able to tell if a memory has been altered.  
Sabastian(smile): We are, after all, capable of shifting memories as needed.  
Sabastian(smile): It would take someone highly skilled at memory manipulation to deceive us.  
Narrator: You nod, studying the room, imagining Mary's final moments of life, bleeding out on the bed.  
Narrator: Her child murdered in front of her.  
Narrator: A chill shivers through your spine at the thought.  
Eve(confuse): Well... any chance there were security cameras?  
Sabastian: Afraid not. Dracula has always hated the technology of your world.  
Eve(confuse): So, what are we looking for exactly?  
Sabastian: Anything that might give us a hint into Mary's life.  
Sabastian: We know her child didn't belong to Dracula. Did she have other lovers?  
Eve: Maybe one that's jealous enough to kill her for staying with Dracula?  
Sabastian: Do you think the father of the murdered child may be the culprit?  
Eve(confuse): I think...

## A. Yes, I do.  
## B. No, I don't.  
## C. I still don't know.  
#### A  
Eve(Smile): He's gotta be. Maybe Mary told him she chose Dracula over him.  
Eve: And in his rage he killed them.  
Eve: On Earth, if a woman's dead. Nine times out of ten it's the jealous husband or boyfriend.  
Eve: Every time. Sad, but true.  
#### B  
Eve(sad): If this man was in love with Mary, he'd never kill her.  
Eve(sad): Let alone his own child.  
Eve: There's no way it was him.  
#### C  
Eve(sad): At this point, every answer we get only leads to more questions.  
Sabastian(sad): I agree. We need to keep searching.  
\***  
\>  
Sabastian: Let's keep searching the room for clues. Answers.  
Narrator: Sabastian inspects the dead body as you make your way around the room.  
Narrator: Opening the closet, you're surprised to find casual clothing.  
Narrator: Cotton pants. Blouses. Fancy dresses hang unworn for years in the back, accumulating dust.  
Narrator: Gently closing the closet door, you inspect the clay walls, with a smooth, grainy texture.  
Narrator: Except for one spot. The wall above the dresser.  
Narrator: That spot of the wall, and only that spot, is uncharacteristically shattered. Broken into pieces.

Narrator: Grabbing the bedside chair, you set it down in front of the dresser and hop on top.  
Sabastian(surprise): {Eve Name}! What are you doing?  
Eve: Checking something. Help me out.  
Narrator: Sabastian grips your hips, stabilizing you.  
Narrator: His hands slip under your shirt, gently pressing against your skin.  
Narrator: Your heart melts at his touch as you try your best to ignore the warmth of his hands.  
Narrator: His fingers softly digging into your flesh.  
\>>  
Eve*Think(Shy): I need to stay focused!  
Narrator: Reaching as far as your arms can reach, you shake the bits of wall atop the dresser.  
Narrator: Finally, your persistence pays off as the bits of wall come off, revealing an open crevice!  
Narrator: Burying your hand in, you pull out whatever has been secretly kept there.  
Sabastian(surprise): What's in there?  
Narrator: Sabastian helps you down off the chair as you both look at what's in your hand.
