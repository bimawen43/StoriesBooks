Narrator: Jerry swings around to face you, but can only throw his arms up in defense.

Narrator: The warm, wet blood flows down your back. You cup your shoulder, trying to stop the bleeding.

Sabastian: I carried your body to Matilda to tend to your wounds, and dragged Jerry's body to the court.

Eve: Sabastian was acting weird earlier today. When he left my bedroom...  
Eve(sad): He seemed... I don't know...  
Eve(sad): It sounded like he was saying goodbye forever.  
Narrator: And that's when it hits you. That pain in your stomach.  
Narrator: The twist in your gut when you got the call that Adam had killed himself.

Eve*Think(sad): Oh God...  
Eve*Think(sad): Was Sabastian saying goodbye forever?

Narrator: It beckons you to come closer.  
Eve(surprise): Yeah I'll... I'll catch up with you all.
