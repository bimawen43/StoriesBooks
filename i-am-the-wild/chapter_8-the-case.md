Elijah(happy): My apologies, I forgot you are still accustomed to sleeping at night.  
Sabastian(happy): I hope the transition to sun-sleep and night-wake will be smooth.

Eve(happy): I am, it seems. No need to worry.

Eve(happy): I had some amazing rest. I've never slept on a bed so comfortable in my life.  
Sabastian(happy): We invested in the nicest silk for you. King-sized. We wanted you to be comfortable.  
Eve(happy): Oh I am, trust me. I've never slept in a bed so big!  
Derek(happy): Feel free to let me know if it's ever too big for you.

Sabastian(happy): Of course we did!  
Elijah(happy): Vampires need their sleep too?  
Eve: Did you sleep in your coffins? Like... in the stories?  
Narrator: Elijah shrugs.  
Elijah(happy): The coffins simply ensure we are undisturbed by sunlight.  
Derek(happy): But any closed rooms suffice.  
Liam: Needless to say we're cautious of any rooms that only have blinds or curtains.  
Liam: But our bedrooms are more than safe.  
Sabastian(happy): And significantly more comfortable than a coffin.  
Elijah(happy): Yes. I can't tell you how many back cramps you get sleeping on your back like that.

Derek(happy): Regardless, she was more than thrilled to hear a human would be staying with us.  
Derek(happy): And well... she may have out down herself.

Narrator: Pancakes. Eggs. Sausages. Yogurt. Hashbrowns. Everything you love, steaming hot and freshly made.  
Sabastian(happy): Suffice to say she went a bit overboard.

Narrator: Sitting down at the table, you help yourself to stacks of pancakes, eggs, bacon, and everything else on the table.

Narrator: You scoop a big bite of eggs, turning to the hashbrowns on your plate.  
Eve(happy): Much simpler system than whatever you're currently using.  
\>>  
Elijah(surprise): Hold on. You're telling us you finished all of those books?  
Elijah: I gave you thousands of documents outlining vampire law. The history. All of it.  
Sabastian(happy): Took us years to understand that.  
Eve(happy): The four of you can lift a car. Move at superhuman speed. Snap someone in half life a twig.

Eve(happy): How is it do you think I earned my law degree at Harvard so easily?  
Sabastian(happy): My goodness, you are an impressive specimen.  
Elijah(happy): No doubt about that.  
Derek(happy): Quite a find, indeed.

Elijah(happy): How many bailiffs are required if a centaur is in court?

Eve: 3.  
\>>>  
Sabastian: Who acts as judges for all court cases?  
\>>  
Eve: Dragons. Which is weird to me. Why is that?  
\>  
Derek: Dragons have lived for thousands of years. Ancient beasts.  
Elijah: They've acquired knowledge far beyond other creatures. They act as ideal judges.  
Sabastian: Impartial. Objective. And vastly full of knowledge and wisdom.  
Eve: Ahh. I see.  
\>>>  
Liam: When was the Vampire Violence Act imposed?  
\>>  
Eve: 1562, after the criminal case Lois v State.  
\>  
Eve: A vampire killed three woman.  
Eve: Arguing that he was dying of hunger and needed to drain them to live.  
Eve: He was set free, but a new law was made protecting others from vampires.

Sabastian: When was the Mill Interference Act rejected, and why?  
\>>  
Eve: 1943. It was an act that would have creatures enter earth and kill dictators.  
Eve: The act was written because of World War 2. Basically, you wanted to kill Hitler.  
Eve: It was rejected after the courts decided your world shouldn't intervene with ours.  
Eve: The lawmakers that wrote the act justified that ending the war would save millions of human lives.  
Eve: It was utilitarian, meaning the greater good.  
Eve: That's why it's called the Mill Interference Act.

Eve(happy): You're right. I have so much ahead of me to look forward to!  
Narrator: You stuff your phone into your back pocket, out of sight and out of mind.  
Liam(happy): I'd be happy to rid you of your earthly device, my dear.  
Narrator: Raising his fingers, he snaps golden flames into existence, dancing around his hand.  
Narrator: You stare, bug-eyed at Liam.  
\>>  
Eve(surprise): That's something you can just do? Shoot fire out of your hand?  
Narrator: Liam glances up at you, but it's not him that answers.  
Dracula(smile): Of course he can. Did you not know?  
\>  
Dracula(smile): My, my. Were the Night Brothers too modest about their gifts?  
Narrator: You swivel around.  
#### B  
Narrator: Tossing your phone on the ground, you stomp it with your feet.  
Narrator: Expecting a dramatic spray of glass and metal, the phone doesn't break. The screen doesn't even crack.  
Narrator: Disappointment hits you hard.  
Narrator: The dramatic finale of this conversation is not happening how you envisioned.  
\>>  
Eve(angry): Seriously?  
Narrator: Liam holds out his hand.  
Liam(happy): May I?  
Narrator: You hand it to him.  
Narrator: To your utter shock and astonishment, his hand lights on fire, peeling out from his palm.  
Narrator: They engulf the phone in dancing, golden flames.  
Narrator: The phone melts in his hand, and he drops it onto the table and takes a napkin to wipe his palm.  
Narrator: You stare, bug-eyed at Liam.  
Eve(surprise): That's something you can just do? Shoot fire out of your hand?  
Narrator: Liam glances up at you, but it's not him that answers.  
Dracula(smile): Of course he can. Did you not know?

Narrator: Dracula steps into the dining room, looking as posh and fancy ever.  
Dracula(smile): Good morning, all. I let myself in, I hope you don't mind.  
Liam(angry): We do mind.  
Derek(happy): It's fine. Come in, sire. Please.  
Narrator: But Dracula already invites himself into the room, standing close to you.  
Dracula(smile): The Night Brothers are so much more than vampires.  
Dracula(smile): Before I turned them, they were once Sacred Druids of the Holy Order.  
Dracula(smile): A secret sect devoted to the higher calling of the gods of nature.  
\>>  
Eve*Think(surprise): They were druids before they were vampires! I remember them telling me that.  
Eve(happy): Yeah, they told me that. They have powers relating to their own element.  
Eve(happy): Earth, air, fire, and water.  
Dracula(smile): Did they tell you they were Gods? Creatures revered them. Killed for them.  
Dracula(smile): You're looking at 4 monsters responsible for the death of millions.  
Dracula(smile): Until they were rejected by their followers. Chastized for blood on their hands.  
Dracula(smile): They were banished from the Order and cursed with the Unforgiveable Curse.

Eve(surprise): What's that?  
Dracula(smile): They were branded with the darkest, most evil aspects of the elements.  
Dracula(smile): The elements to which they held in such reverence - earth, air, fire, and water.  
Dracula(smile): Doomed to a life of pain and hurting all those they had sworn soul vows to help.  
\>  
Dracula(smile): The inner conflict of their new demons drove them mad!  
Narrator: Sabastian flinches at his words, ghis hands clenched to his sides.  
\>>>  
Sabastian(angry): Don't, Dracula. Don't tell her.  
\>>  
Dracula(smile): She deserves to know, young one.  
Eve(sad): Know what?  
Dracula(smile): These four brothers made a suicide pact.  
Dracula(smile): Shamed by the death they have caused, the druids decided only they had the power to end it.  
Dracula(smile): They were going to kill themselves.  
Dracula(smile): I found them just before the last vestiges of life had left their bodies. I saved them.  
Derek(angry): Turned us.  
Dracula(smile): Semantics, child.  
Dracula(smile): I made them practically immortal, so they could never follow through with their pact.  
Dracula(smile): I stopped them from killing themselves.  
\>  
Dracula(smile): Compelled them to never attempt anything that could lead to suicide or imminent death.  
Dracula(smile): I... compelled them to live.  
Narrator: Derek glances away, his shoulders slumped.  
Narrator: Liam refuses to make eye contact with anyone.  
Narrator: But a daunting realization hits you that nearly topples you to the ground.  
Eve(sad): So this means... the deal you spoke of yesterday. The deal you all made with Dracula.  
Sabastian(sad): That if we free him of this criminal case, he agrees to lift this curse he bit us with.  
Eve(sad): Then... if we succeed... you'll all just go and kill yourselves?!  
Narrator: None of the brothers can say anything, all the answer you need.

Eve*Think(sad): I can't believe this! If we succeed in this legal acse against Dracula, the brothers will die!  
# (iatw_08_10_brothers_will_die)  
## A. You can't do that!  
## B. I understand.  
## C. That's horrible.  
#### A  
Eve(sad): You can't just... die! After everything you've been through, I-  
Sabastian(sad): It's not that simple, {Eve Name}. It's... more complicated than that.  
\>>  
Eve(angry): No it's not. Killing yourself is never the answer.  
Eve(sad): How could you say that? After everything I went through with Adam...  
Narrator: A deep sadness falls onto Sabastian, as he struggles to answer.  
Narrator: Instead he, and the other brothers, only bow their heads down in shame.  
Elijah(sad): The things we've done as Druids. The lives we've ended.  
\>  
Derek(sad): It's a shame we will never endure, I'm afraid.  
#### B  
Eve(sad): It sounds like you've all done some horrible things as Druids.  
Eve(sad): Maybe it's impossible to look back at your life with melancoly.  
\>>  
Eve(sad): Only shame.  
Eve(sad): And wanting to be at peace with that is understandable.  
\>  
Eve(sad): Obviously I don't agree with it, especially after what I went through with Adam.  
Eve(sad): But I suppose it's not my place to stop you.  
#### C  
\>>  
Eve(sad): You can't do that. To yourself. To your grandmother. To me!  
Eve(sad): You have to think of your loved ones. You have to!  
Narrator: A deep sadness falls onto Sabastian, as he struggles to answer.  
\>  
Narrator: Instead he, and the other brothers, only bow their heads down in shame.  
Elijah(sad): The things we've done as Druids. The lives we've ended.  
Derek(sad): It's a shame we will never endure, I'm afraid.  
\***  
Eve*Think(sad): The brothers were magical ancient druids, and Dracula collected them like dolls.  
Eve*Think(sad): He ordered them to stay alive even when their lives had turned into their worst nightmares.  
Narrator: You stare at the brothers, all of them slumped into their chairs.  
Narrator: In a flash, their personalities come into focus.  
\>>  
Eve*Think(sad): I can feel the wounds hidden beneath Liam's anger.  
Eve*Think(sad): The stubbornness in Sabastian.  
Eve*Think(sad): The stoic intellectualism in Elijah.  
\>  
Eve*Think(sad): And the flirtatious charisma of Derek.  
Eve*Think(sad): They carry their sorrows in their own way.  
Narrator: For a moment, you wonder if your job wasn't just to assist them with legal knowledge.  
Narrator: To read their notes. Write their transcripts. Counsel them with your legal expertise.  
Narrator: Maybe it's something deeper. Something more important.  
Eve*Think(sad): Maybe it's my job to save the Night Brothers from themselves.  
Eve*Think(sad): Convince them that this world is worth staying in!  
Eve*Think(sad): If only I understood how...  
\>>  
Sabastian(happy): We have a full day ahead of us, don't we?  
Derek(happy): Yes! Court is in a few days.  
Derek(happy): We must begin our investigation into the murder of Dracula's wife.  
Eve(happy): Where do we start?  
Narrator: The brothers stand, leaving the dining room and this conversation as swiftly as possible.  
Derek(sad): Come. Our case discovery begins now.  
Narrator: You follow the brothers out of the dining room with Dracula.
