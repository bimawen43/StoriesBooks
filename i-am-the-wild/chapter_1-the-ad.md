\>>  
Sabastian(smile): If we sat close to each other, we'd look like we were on our way to a ball together.  
Eve(shy): Well thanks. You don't look too shabby yourself.  
Sabastian(smile): Where I'm from, this is how all men should dress.  
Eve(smile): I should visit where you're from more often.  
\>  
Eve(happy): And where would be that be exactly?  
Sabastian(smile): Far from here, I can assure you.  
Eve(smile): Based on your accent you sound "across the pond."  
Sabastian(happy): London is one of my favorite places to visit, but I'm not from "across the pond" as you say.

Sabastian(smile): You just drew this? In the last few minutes?  
Eve(happy): It's a hobby.  
\>>  
Sabastian(smile): You're skilled enough for it to be more than that.  
Eve(sad): Yeah well. Some of us are doomed to work in a field that's not our passion.  
Sabastian: A sad tale indeed.

Eve(sad): I love drawing. I wish I could do it as a career, but I've always been a business woman.  
Sabastian(happy): Cursed with intelligence beyond your art. I'm afraid I can relate to that.

Eve(smile): Where is it you're headed tonight, Sabastian?  
Sabastian(smile): Work.  
Eve(happy): You don't peg me as someone that typically takes the subway to work.  
Sabastian(happy): I take the subway because cars are boring. I like looking for trouble.  
Eve(happy): Is that what you are? Trouble?  
Sabastian(smile): I am many things, {Eve Name}.

Sabastian(happy): Subways get you where you want to be. Right now, it's here with you.  
Eve(happy): Well, I hope I wasn't too hard to find.  
Sabastian(smile): The opposite. I couldn't sit back there without coming over here.  
Sabastian(happy): If I had your talents I'd sketch you too.  
\>>>  
Eve(smile): Draw me just sitting here?  
\>>  
Sabastian(smile): And maybe some poses while I'm at it. You're not the only one with an imagination.

Narrator: You blush, pulling your eyes away from his.  
Eve(happy): You look like you walked straight out of a GQ magazine.  
Sabastian(happy): If I told you where I actually walked out of, I don't think you'd believe me.  
Eve(surprise): Is that so? Try me.  
Sabastian(smile): I'm fairly certain I could tell you things that would blow your mind.  
Sabastian(happy): But I'm afraid tonight will not be that night.  
Eve(happy): You can at least tell me what you do.  
Sabastian(smile): I'm a lawyer.  
Eve(smile): Based on the cut of your suit, I doubt you're a public defender. Private practice?  
Sabastian(happy): Impressive. Yes, with my brothers.  
Eve(happy): So you're saying there are more of you?  
Sabastian(happy): Many more. But I'm the best looking.  
Eve(happy): I'll need to see the competition before I can agree with you.  
Sabastian(happy): Something tells me you just might very soon.  
Narrator: He smiles again, this time his eyes burying into you. You lose the breath that was in your mouth.  
Eve*Think(shy): Oh my God. What does he mean by that?  
Eve*Think(shy): There's definitely something about him that... I just can't figure out!  
\***  
Sabastian(happy): So, what's someone like you doing so late in a place like this?  
\>>  
Eve(happy): A job interview.  
Narrator: Sabastian's eyes go wide. He chuckles, clearing his throat before speaking.  
Sabastian(happy): A job interview in the middle of the night? That's quite peculiar.  
Narrator: The subway screeches to a halt.  
Narrator: Sabastian's eyes finally leave yours as he peers over to the doors.  
Sabastian(happy): Well this is my stop.  
\>  
Eve(happy): Funny. This is mine too.  
Narrator: You stand up as both of you head to the exit.

Narrator: He adjusts his suit jacket cuffs, striding off with confidence.  
Eve*Think(surprise): Okay enough staring. I gotta get to this interview!  
Narrator: You hustle off in the opposite direction, up the steps leading out of the subway and into the streets.

Narrator: Stamped on the front desk is a logo and the name 'The Night Firm'.  
Eve*Think(surprise): Oh, is it a law firm?  
Eve*Think(surprise): But why would a law firm be open this late?  
Eve*Think(surprise): And where even is everybody?

Eve(smile): Are you one of the lawyers?  
Matilda(smile): My talents lay in many things, but not in the judiciary world.  
Eve(sad): If you don't mind me asking...  
Eve(surprise): Why are you open so late? I mean... most lawyers work normal business hours.  
Eve(surprise): The legal field requires you to coordinate and facilitate with other businesses, courthouses...  
Eve(surprise): Isn't it going to be hard to work with them if you're in the office while they're all in bed?  
Matilda(smile): A fair point, but I'm afraid our work is not impeded by such things.  
Matilda(smile): But please, leave your questions for the interview.  
Matilda(smile): They will be answered shortly. I promise.

Narrator: Running your hand along with the fabric, you can't help but feel something strange...  
Narrator: That this chair, along with Matilda's, has been around for thousands of years.  
Narrator: You inhale deeply, sinking into your seat.  
Eve*Think: Well. Guess I'll just wait here.  
Narrator: Matilda gets up from her seat and leaves the front room, leaving you completely alone.  
Narrator: And you wait. For a long time. You fidget in your seat, tapping your fingers on the edge of the chair.  
Narrator: You spend the time analyzing the room for any clues as to what type of workplace this is.  
Eve*Think(surprise): All of the furniture is so old. Like... something you'd see out of a castle.  
Eve*Think(surprise): And it's so sparse!  
Eve*Think(surprise): It's almost as if they just moved here.

Narrator: But as time passes, and games become boring, you finally check the time again.

Narrator: You spring to your feet, fixing your clothes.  
Eve*Think(sad): I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I fell for something so stupid.  
Narrator: You turn to the door to storm out, when suddenly a voice chimes out.  
Matilda(happy): They'll see you now.  
Narrator: Her voice startles you. You turn around and see the old woman back at her desk.  
Eve(surprise): Woah, when did you get there? I never saw you return to your seat.  
Narrator: The old woman shrugs, clearly avoiding your question.  
Narrator: But a small smirk creeps on her face, telling you she's doing it on purpose.

Matilda(happy): We apologize for the wait. Busy day it seems.  
Narrator: She waves you to a large wooden door close to her desk.  
Narrator: You stare at her, then the door, before sighing in frustration.  
Eve*Think(angry): Whatever. I'm so desperate for money at this point. Might as well see this thing through.  
Narrator: You approach the door, Matilda beaming a smile at you from ear to ear.
