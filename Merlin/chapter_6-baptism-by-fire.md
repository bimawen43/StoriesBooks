Narrator: You stand up, looking for Teague. Just then, a sudden squeak grabs your attention.  
\*Rat Name Rat  
Narrator: You look around, trying to find the source of the sound. You catch a glimpse of a rat running across the floor.  
Rat: Squeak! Poor ma'am.  
Merlin*Think: Is this the result of Teague's spell? I can still speak to animals!  
Narrator: The mouse squeaks in sympathy. He steals a piece of food from your mothers plate and quickly sneaks away into a/the corner.  
Narrator: He drags his prize into his cave at lightning speed.  
Merlin*Think(surprise): So fast! Maybe I can use him to steal the key...  
Merlin: Hey, little guy!  
Narrator: The mouse is astonished, dropping his meal and whirling to face you.  
\>>  
Rat(surprise): What?! You can speak to me?!  
\>  
Merlin: Easy, pal. I just know some magic.  
Merlin: Why are you here?  
Narrator: The little rat gives you a disdainful look.  
Rat: I'm on vacation. What do you think, idiot girl? I live here.  
Merlin*Think(surprise): Such an attitude from such a small creature...  
Narrator: The rat stares at you, wary and slightly hostile.  
Merlin*Think: How can I convince him to help me?

Merlin(sad): If this is your home then no one would knows this place better than you!  
Rat: Of course! I know this place like the back of my paw!  
Merlin(sad): So you must know where they keep the key? Could you steal it for me?  
Rat: What?! Steal the key? No! I'll be dead if they catch me!  
Merlin(smile): But a quick and nimble rat such as yourself could never get caught by those drunkards...  
Rat: Hmm... That is true... They've been at it all night. I bet they can barely stand.  
Merlin(smile): I thought you were the cleverest rat in the dungeon, but maybe I was wrong...  
Merlin(smile): I can ask someone else...  
Rat: Wait!  
#### B  
Merlin(sad): My mother... She's terribly wounded. I need to get her out of here.  
Rat: Yes, the poor ma'am. What they did to her was so cruel!  
Merlin(sad): Then... will you help me save her? Please?  
Narrator: The rat hesitates, concern evident in his quivering whiskers.  
Merlin(sad): Little guy, please. I'm begging you! I really need the key! I have to save my mother's life.  
\***  
Rat: ...Alright. I'll do it.  
Narrator: The rat vanishes into his cave. All you can do now is trust him.

Narrator: She mumbles incoherently, sweat beading on her brow.  
Merlin(sad): Mother... This necklace you gave me. Where did it come from?  
Merlin(sad): Earlier, it flashed a bright light and protected me...  
Narrator: Hearing your words, your mother is surprised, then she sighs.  
Kate(sad): {Merlin Name}, listen to me. You must leave this county and never come back!  
Asher(sad): Kate, what are you saying?  
Kate(sad): Leave, {Merlin Name}. You must do this for me...  
Merlin(sad): Mother...  
Narrator: You hold her hand through the bars and squeeze it gently.  
Narrator: Her breathing is labored and painful.

Merlin(sad): Mother, hold on. We'll get home soon.  
Kate(sad): Sorry, {Merlin Name}, I can't take care of you anymore.  
Kate(sad): I just want you to be safe.  
Narrator: Your mother uses every last ounce of energy to take one final look at you.  
\>>  
Merlin(cry): No! You'll get better for sure!  
Narrator: With tears rolling down your her cheeks, she closes her eyes.  
Asher(sad): Hang on, Kate, we're getting out of here!  
Kate(sad): I can't make it, Asher...  
Asher(sad): Yes, you can. You can!  
Narrator: He squeezes her hand in despair. She manages one final smile before her arms slump.

Rat: Squeak!  
Narrator: In the blink of an eye, the rat vanishes back into his cave.  
Merlin(surprise): ...  
Merlin*Think(sad): If I had accepted Teague's spell... That rat could have been a useful ally...

Merlin(sad): ...There must be another way.  
Asher(surprise): {Merlin Name}?

Teague(angry): I'm well aware of that.  
Narrator: Teague points to the guard's waist. You see a bunch of keys hanging on it.  
Teague: They're drunk. This is our chance.  
Merlin(angry): You fetch the key. I'll cover you.  
Narrator: You swagger towards the guards, waving your hands. The guards widen their eyes, staring at you in disbelief.  
Victor(surprise): Whh...at? Are you real?  
Merlin(smile): Why don't you come and take a closer look?  
Victor(angry): Lord Chesterfield put a bounty on your head. And now, you just brought it to us!

Narrator*Top: ??? | {Merlin Name}...  
Narrator: You manage to keep your eyes open and look around.  
Narrator: The air in the prison is frosty and stale. The two guards outside the door have slumped to the ground, asleep.  
Narrator*Top: ??? | Here, {Merlin Name}...  
Narrator: A big snake slithers between the window bars.  
Big_Horn: ...  
Merlin(surprise): Was that you speaking?  
Big_Horn: Do you see anyone else around?  
Merlin(surprise): Teague's spell works on snakes, too?  
Big_Horn: Didn't think you would master druid magic so quickly. This will make things easier.  
Merlin(surprise): ...Did you intentionally lead me to see Teague when I ran across you the first time?  
Big_Horn: You're pretty smart.  
Merlin: But...

## A. How did you get here so quickly?  
## B. Who is Teague to you?  
#### A  
Narrator: The snake flicks his tail disdainfully.  
Big_Horn: {Merlin Name}, How did <i>you</i> get here so fast?  
Merlin*Think(shy): I turned into a bird...  
Merlin(smile): Alright, I see your point.  
#### B  
Big_Horn: He is my pet. He served me as a hatchling and lent me his magic.  
Merlin(surprise): He's <i>your</i> pet?  
Big_Horn: I thought he was lonely, waiting in that drafty temple for eighteen years...  
Big_Horn: So I took pity on him and made him my pet.  
\***  
Merlin(smile): Did Teague send you to rescue me?  
Big_Horn: That's beyond me, but I'm here to get a sample of your blood.  
Big_Horn: This might hurt a bit, but don't worry, {Merlin Name}.  
Merlin(surprise): What?  
Narrator: Before you can react, the snake bites your arm. The sharp fangs barely break your skin in a small pinch...  
Big_Horn: Alright, I'm going now.  
Merlin(sad): Wait...  
# (mm_06n_09_CP_merlins_blood)  
## A. What does Teague want my blood for?  
## B. How is my father?  
## C. When is Teague coming to save me?  
#### A  
Big_Horn: Blood magic... He's the second person I know to try this. I couldn't dissuade him...  
Merlin(surprise): What do you mean by that?  
Big_Horn: ...  
Narrator: The snake does not respond.  
#### B  
Big_Horn: The old blacksmith? He's still alive.  
Merlin(sad): That's a relief...  
Big_Horn: ...

Merlin(surprise): ...What are you doing here?  
Narrator: The serpent magically slithers inside between the window bars.  
Narrator: He slithers up your arm, staring at you with two black eyes.  
Merlin(smile): Are you trying to tell me something?  
Narrator: Suddenly, the serpent bites down on your arm. The sharp fangs break your skin, but it's barely a pinch.  
Merlin(surprise): What was that for?!  
Narrator: Without another glance, the snake winds its way back out through the window.

John(smile): Let God decide this witch's fate!  
Narrator: The mob cheers.  
Narrator: Lord Chesterfield turns and glares at you with a victorious smirk.  
John(angry): {Merlin Name} Smith, daughter of Asher Smith, sold her soul to the Devil for wicked power and blasphemy.  
John(angry): May God punish her!  
Narrator: The spectators jeer and throw rocks at you. You lower your head.

Lancelot(smile): Forgive us, God! Forgive us for falsely accusing an innocent and being deceived by the wicked!  
Narrator: Lightning strikes again and Lord Chesterfield shrieks in agony as flames roar to life around him.  
Lancelot(surprise): God has shown his power!  
Narrator: You look at Lord Chesterfield and see only a charred skeleton.  
Narrator: The crowd gasps and stares at the flames in fear before kneeling en masse.  
Narrator: Crowd | May God forgive our sin!  
Narrator: The storm recedes, as if cast away by the crowd's prayers.  
Narrator: A soft ray of light breaks through the dark clouds and beams down upon you.

Narrator: Lancelot rushes up and unties you,you sink to the ground in relief.  
Lancelot(sad): Are you alright, {Merlin Name}?  
Narrator: You stare at his nervous and caring face.  
Merlin(sad): I'm fine. I'm just... a little bit cold.  
Narrator: You tremble violently as the wind blows on your rain-soaked clothes.  
Narrator: Suddenly, you hear a shrill voice from the crowd.  
Narrator: Man | She is not the Saintess! She's an impostor!  
Narrator: Man | She's just a country bumpkin. What happened just now is merely her con job.  
Merlin(surprise): ...  
Narrator: His words provoke an uproar in the crowd. People look at each other in confusion and talk in whispers. They size you up with sharp and suspicious eyes.  
Narrator: At this moment, a woman who is holding her child squeezes out of the crowd and gives you a splendid dress.  
Narrator: Woman | My honorable Saintess. I trust you. Please change into the clean dress. It will showcase your glory.  
Lancelot(smile): {Merlin Name}, change into it. Don't let down the people who trust you.  
Lancelot: This is a dangerous situation. The crowd could riot at any time.

Narrator: The soft fabric fits you perfectly. You raise your head confidently and direct your gaze at the man who questioned you.  
Merlin(smile): I stand for justice! And you called Divine retribution a con job?  
Narrator: You point at the charred skeleton of Lord Chesterfield on the ground. The man is a little scared and backs up several steps.  
Narrator: Crowd | {Merlin Name},{Merlin Name}!
