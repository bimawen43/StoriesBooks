Merlin(shy): Sorry...  
\***  
Lancelot(smile): No need to be sorry.  
Merlin: Aren't your legs aching as well?  
Lancelot: Not as much... I told you I've been training to be a knight, yeah?  
Lancelot(happy): For now, that means running drills and preparing my body for combat.  
Merlin(smile): Woah... You do that in addition to your work?  
Lancelot(smile): Every morning.

Lancelot: Those miserable games have been going on for months...  
Lancelot: Yet no one has stood up to him the way you have.

#### A  
Lancelot(surprise): Your necklace...?  
Merlin(sad): That flash of light. I think it came from this necklace.  
#### B  
Lancelot(happy): Oh yeah? I almost feel sorry for the man, having you for an enemy.  
Merlin(smile): Ugh, don't waste your pity on him.

Merlin(sad): So did I, but...  
#### B  
Lancelot(smile): Should I be afraid? I'm alone with a witch...  
Merlin(smile): Oh yes, I'm very frightening. If you upset me, I might turn you into a newt.  
Lancelot(happy): I think I would make a very handsome newt, don't you?  
Narrator: The two of you laugh together, but your thoughts soon turn serious again.  
\***  
Merlin: Witchcraft, huh?  
Narrator: You gently lift your necklace and run your fingers over the smooth stone.  
Merlin(sad): How else would you explain it?  
Lancelot: Maybe it's something better left a mystery. Consider it luck, or fate, or divine intervention.  
Merlin: Maybe...

Narrator: You lift your hands high, and your body emits a soft, pure light.  
Narrator: As the light becomes brighter and brighter, the desolate call of a horn sounds across the field, and the shouts of the crowd shake the earth.

Narrator: Vivien rides back to the side of the Saxon king, and through a series of complex hand gestures begins to summon a black mist from the ground.  
Vivien: I take my blood to open your eyes; my bones to cast your blades; lend me your light in my name.  
Vivien: All soulless things beneath the ground, hear me!  
Vivien: Take this blood as my offering and arise! Arise! Arise!  
Lilith(surprise): You've summoned the undead! Vivien, do you realize what you've done?  
Vivien: Now you know what happened to your reinforcements.  
Lilith(sad): Vivien, those men trusted you with their lives! The Druids are your family!
