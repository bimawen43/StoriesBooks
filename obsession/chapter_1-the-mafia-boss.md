Kate(sad): He got away.  
Kelly(angry): Ugh. Damn it. On foot?

Levine(surprise): Why didn't he have you killed?  
Kate: Captain...  
# (obs_01_15_why_not_have_killed)  
## A. I don't know.  
## B. Maybe he was in a good mood?  
## C. Maybe he didn't want to kill a cop?  
#### A  
Kate: Your guess is as good as mine.  
Levine(angry): Castellano never leaves any witnesses.  
#### B  
Levine(surprise): He must have been in a VERY good mood, then.  
Levine(angry): Castellano never leaves any witnesses.  
#### C  
Levine(angry): Oh, Julian Castellano has bloodied his hands many times already.  
Kate(sad): ... Has he?  
\***  
Levine(angry): You shouldn't have gone in there without any backup.  
Levine(angry): What were you thinking?  
Kate(sad): He was just one person... and I didn't want to lose him.  
Kate: Anyway, I did call for backup. (Condition: CALLED_BACKUP_01 >= 1)  
Levine(angry): Damn these budget cuts!  
Levine(angry): I'd have every one of my officers always patrol with a partner, but ever since these cuts...  
Levine(angry): Anyway, you're lucky to still be alive.  
Levine: So the question is...  
\>>R  
Levine: Why are you the first witness he hasn't gotten rid of immediately?  
Levine: What happened back there, Officer?  
\>R  
Kate*Think(sad): I... I can't possibly tell him about the part where he told me to <i>kiss</i> him!  
# (obs_01_16_what_happened)  
## A. I have no idea, Captain.  
## B. He was acting strange.  
## C. He asked me for my name.  
#### A  
Levine: Are you withholding any information from me, Officer?  
Kate: No! Of course not, Captain.  
#### B  
Levine(surprise): Strange? What do you mean?  
Kate: He, er... kept staring at me.  
Levine(surprise): Staring at you.  
Kate(sad): Yeah.  
#### C  
Levine(surprise): He asked for your name? Why on earth did he--  
Levine(surprise): And did you tell him?  
Kate(sad): I did. (Condition: TOLD_NAME_01 >= 1)  
Kate(sad): No, I didn't. But he said he was going to find out anyway. (Condition: TOLD_NAME_01 < 1)  
Levine(surprise): This is...

## A. This guy...  
\***  
Narrator: You turn and look at the person who just spoke.  
Narrator: The man who has just entered Captain Levine's office frowns slightly as he looks at you.  
Kate*Think(surprise): I've seen him in the station twice since I started here... but never up close.  
Narrator: You take a closer look at him...  
\>>R  
Michael: ...  
\>R  
Narrator: He's tall and obviously muscular under his crisp white shirt and fitted suit.  
Narrator: He's also undeniably, ridiculously good-looking with strong chiseled features, despite the two-day stubble on his jaw.  
Kate*Think(shy): Wow... he's <i>gorgeous</i>.  
Narrator: There are smile lines around the corners of his eyes, but something tells you that he doesn't smile a lot these days.  
Narrator: His presence exuded a raw power... almost like the one you felt in Julian Castellano...  
Narrator: Except his was contained, <i>controlled</i>... unlike Julian's, whose power was like a violent storm.  
Narrator: But there's something about this man... something that you can't place your finger on.  
Narrator: His eyes don't leave you at all, and you feel yourself blushing under his intense stare.  
Kate(surprise): Who are you?  
Levine: {Kate Name}, this is Michael. He's our best detective in the Gang squad.

Michael: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's the reason why.  
Narrator: He studies your face again for a few more seconds before continuing.  
Michael: He couldn't bring himself to kill her... because she resembles someone.  
Kate(surprise): Resembles someone?  
Levine(surprise): Who?
