Alice\(sad\): That's not what I'm nervous about... but whatever.  
Armand: Don't worry, {Alice Name}. You have nothing to worry about.

Narrator: Armand's smile widens at your reply.  
&gt;&gt;  
Armand\(smile\): I'm glad to hear that.  
Anne\(angry\): Blech, spare us that crap.  
Alice\(angry\): Nobody asked for your opinion, and please stop listening in to private conversations.

Anne: Did you expect us to travel without our servants? We're not peasants.  
Alice_Think\(angry\): Must... stay calm... and not let her get to me.  
Narrator: Jeanne shoots you a sympathetic look, and you smile gratefully back at her.  
Narrator: You look curiously at the man and the other female servant, who had gotten out of the carriage with her.  
Narrator: The man looks familiar...  
Alice_Think: Oh! I think he was with Armand yesterday at the market when Armand rescued me.  
Armand: Please assist the Palace staff wherever possible, Guillaume.  
Guillaume: Yes, my Lord.  
Narrator: Guillaume busies himself with helping the palace footmen to bring the horses and the carriage away.  
Alice_Think: Guillaume must be Armand's footman.  
Narrator: You turn to see Anne ordering the other servant, a timid, mousy-looking creature.  
&gt;&gt;  
Anne: You can bring my traveling case back to my room for now.  
Anne: Oh, and prepare my violet silk dress for this evening.  
Anne\(angry\): Well? What are you waiting for? Step to it, Francine!  
Francine\(sad\): Yes, my lady!  
&gt;  
Narrator: The frightened young maid scurries off quickly, lugging a huge pink and gold travel case.  
Alice_Think: That must be Anne's handmaid.  
Alice_Think\(sad\): Poor girl... She seems absolutely terrified of Anne.  
Narrator: Armand turns towards the footman who had opened your carriage door.  
Armand: I shouldn't expect to be leaving until around four in the afternoon...  
Armand: I'll send Guillaume to the stables before we leave, so the horses can be made ready.
