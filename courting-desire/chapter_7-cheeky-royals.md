Narrator: As you slowly open your eyes, the first thing you notice, is that you seem to be lying on the ground.  
Narrator: The second thing you notice, is Armand's lips pressed against yours.  
Narrator: His lips are soft and warm, and for a brief, dreamy moment, you wonder if he is kissing you.  
Narrator: Suddenly, you start coughing, and he quickly rolls you over to your side as you hack out water from your lungs!  
&gt;&gt;&gt;  
Alice\(cry\): Cough!!! Cough!!!  
&gt;&gt;  
Alice\(sad\): What... cough... what happened...  
Armand\(sad\): Don't try to talk yet, just rest first.  
Narrator: Another minute goes by as you keep coughing out water bit by bit, as Armand rubs your back.  
Armand\(sad\): Just keep breathing. In... out. In... out.  
Narrator: Your eyes slowly focus on him.  
Alice\(surprise\): Armand...

## \(cd\_07\_01\_armand\_breathing\)

### A. You're dripping wet!

### B. I'm dripping wet!

### C. I need more mouth to mouth resuscitation.

**A**

Narrator: Armand laughs out loud at your observation.  
Armand\(smile\): So are you.  
Narrator: You start shivering as you realize that he's right...  
Narrator: You're completely wet, from head to toe!

**B**

Narrator: Armand laughs out loud at your observation.  
Armand: Are you cold? Here...  
Narrator: He shrugs off his jacket and covers you with it.  
Alice\(shy\): Thank you.

**C**

Narrator: Armand laughs out loud at your request.  
Armand\(smile\): I think you should be fine for now, if you're able to joke.  
\*_\*  
Narrator: It's only then that you remember with a sudden shock what had happened just a few moments before.  
Alice\(sad\): Oh my god, I was in the pond...  
&gt;&gt;&gt;  
Alice\(sad\): {_Joyful I was sinking.}  
&gt;&gt;  
Armand: Shhh, it's okay now. Everything is okay.  
Narrator: You finally notice another figure crouched beside you, his face furrowed in concern.

Alice\(sad\): Cough... Philippe.  
Philippe\(sad\): We heard screaming and ran over.  
Alice\(surprise\): You heard me screaming?  
&gt;  
Jeanne\(sad\): It was me, milady.  
Jeanne\(sad\): I'd just stepped out of the Palace, and was coming to find you...  
Jeanne\(sad\): When I saw you thrashing in the pond!  
Jeanne\(sad\): I screamed for help and his Grace and my Lord came running over.  
&gt;&gt;  
Philippe: Armand jumped in the pond immediately, and pulled you out.  
Philippe\(sad\): You were unconscious by then.  
Armand\(sad\): We feared the worst...  
&gt;  
Jeanne\(sad\): Oh, milady... I was so afraid...  
Narrator: The handmaid starts crying huge sobs.  
&gt;&gt;  
Alice: Jeanne, it's alright. I'm alright.  
Armand: Yes, thank God.  
Alice: Armand... This is the second time that you've saved me.

## \(cd\_07\_02\_armand\_save\_second\)

### A. I owe you my life.

### B. I need to stop getting in trouble like this.

### C. How are you always around when I need you?

**A**

Narrator: Armand flushes slightly.  
Armand: You don't owe me anything.  
Alice: Seriously, that's two days in a row now that you've rescued me. How will I ever pay you back?  
Narrator: He flashes his dimpled grin.  
Armand: Well I don't mind rescuing you all the time... But maybe try to stay out of trouble from now on.

**B**

Alice\(sad\): It seems like ever since I've been here, trouble just keeps finding me.  
Jeanne\(sad\): Oh, milady, it was my fault. I should have been by your side!  
Alice: Nonsense, Jeanne. I was the one who asked you to wait for me in the Palace.

**C**

Alice: You're like my knight in shining armour.  
Narrator: Armand flushes slightly, even as Jeanne frowns in confusion.  
Jeanne: But my Lord is a Duke, not a knight. And he doesn't wear armour...  
Alice\(smile\): Ah ha ha, it's just one of our modern expressions.  
Armand: Knight in shining armour, huh? I like that.  
Narrator: His expression turns serious again.  
Armand: But I may not always be there when you need me.  
Alice\(sad\): I know. I'll need to be more careful from now on.  
\*\*\*  
Philippe: Speaking of which, if you don't mind me asking, Lady {Alice Name}...  
Philippe: How did you end up in the pond? Did you accidentally trip and fall in?  
Alice\(angry\): I did not.  
Philippe\(surprise\): Then how--  
&gt;&gt;&gt;  
Alice\(angry\): I was **pushed**.  
Philippe\(surprise\): **What??**  
Armand\(surprise\): Someone pushed you in the pond??  
Jeanne\(surprise\): Oh mon Dieu!  
&gt;&gt;  
Narrator: You try to speak, but you start coughing again, and shivering.  
Philippe: Okay, we need to get you out of those wet clothes, and in bed to rest.  
Philippe: You can tell us what happened later.  
&gt;  
Philippe: Jeanne, please tell one of the chambermaids to prepare a chamber for Lady {Alice Name}.  
Jeanne: At once, your Grace.  
Narrator: As Jeanne hurries back towards the Palace, Philippe and Armand turn back to you.  
&gt;&gt;  
Armand: Here, do you think that you can stand?  
Philippe: Perhaps it's better to let one of us carry you in.  
Armand: Yes, I think so too. Better not to exert yourself right now.  
Narrator: Tutorial \| Letting one of them carry you will not only increase Romance with him... It will also make Anne or Marie jealous!

Philippe: Oh I agree. I'll need to have something done about that.

Philippe: It would be easy for anybody to hire someone to finish the deed.  
Philippe: You have no guards there, are you going to personally be by her side twenty four seven?

Armand: If I have to!
