Narrator: You're having tea with the Queen, who seems to have something weighing on her mind.  
Therese: Can I trust you?  
Alice\(surprise\): Madam, I promise that anything you tell me in confidence, I will keep it to myself.  
Narrator: The queen continues staring at you, as if reading into your soul... before making up her mind.  
&gt;&gt;  
Therese\(sad\): It's been particularly lonely the past few weeks...  
Therese\(sad\): Not knowing who I can trust, after Louis was poisoned.  
Therese\(sad\): Can you imagine? Anybody could have done it.  
Therese: Well, except Armand, because he was in Bordeaux.  
Alice\(sad\): You're right, I can't imagine.  
Therese\(sad\): Court rumors have been brutal.  
&gt;  
Therese\(angry\): There are whispers floating around that, 'the Queen must have done it, perhaps she has a lover!'  
Therese\(sad\): And also, 'it must have been Philippe, he wants to be King!'  
Alice\(angry\): Hmm...

## \(cd\_11\_01\_palace\_rumors\)

### A. The rumors must have been started by someone.

### B. Are the both of you the only ones being suspected?

### C. Why do they dare to gossip about you and Philippe?

**A**

Alice\(angry\): Maybe by the very person who did it.  
Therese\(angry\): Perhaps.

**B**

Therese\(sad\): From what I have heard, it seems so.  
Therese\(sad\): And we need to be very careful because Court opinion is very powerful.  
Therese\(sad\): If it gathers enough supporters we could be tried on nothing but hearsay.

**C**

Alice\(surprise\): I mean, you're the queen, and Philippe's the king's brother!  
Therese\(sad\): Anybody can be taken down, {Alice Name}.  
\*\*\*  
Therese\(angry\): I must get to the bottom of this!  
&gt;&gt;  
Therese\(angry\): First of all, to root out this enemy of Louis, hiding in the shadows.  
Therese: Secondly, to clear our names.  
Alice: Madam, Philippe and Armand are also trying to find out who the poisoner is.  
Alice: Have you spoken with them?  
Therese: No. I haven't spoken to anyone, before today.  
Therese: The thing is, I have my suspicions about who did it.  
Alice\(surprise\): You do? But then, **who is it??**  
Therese: Patience, I'll tell you everything. I've been pondering this for a long time...  
Therese: Everyday, in fact, ever since the royal physician said it could be poison.  
Therese: **Who could have a motive for wanting Louis dead?**  
Therese: **Who is powerful enough at court, and close enough to him to pull this off?**  
Therese: There is myself, and Philippe of course...  
&gt;&gt;&gt;  
Therese: And then there's Rene Mazarin.  
Alice\(surprise\): **Mazarin??**

## \(cd\_11\_02\_criminal\_suspect\)

### A. But why?

### B. I knew there was something off about him!

### C. Oh my god, maybe his daughters are in on it too!

**A**

Therese: Why indeed... I asked myself that very same question.

**B**

Alice\(angry\): He's so creepy. So yeah, not surprised at all.  
Narrator: You think for a while.

**C**

Therese: I don't know. They might be involved, they might not even know anything about it.  
Therese: The truth will come out eventually.  
\*\*\*

## cd11\_mazarin\_motive

&gt;&gt;  
Alice: But... what motive could Mazarin have for wanting the king dead?  
Therese: On the surface, it doesn't seem like he has anything to gain if Louis dies.  
Therese\(angry\): But then, remember how he arranged for Marie to marry Philippe?  
Alice: So if Louis dies, because the both of you don't have a son...  
Therese: Philippe becomes King of France, and Marie gets to be Queen.  
Alice: Oh my god... you're right.

## \(cd\_11\_03\_renes\_motive\)

### A. Then he does have a strong motive.

### B. No wonder Marie wants to marry Philippe so badly.

### C. Oh my god, this is like Game of Thrones.

**A**

Alice: His daughter becomes Queen, and he becomes more powerful than ever.

**B**

Alice: She just wants to be Queen.

**C**

Therese: Game of what?  
Alice: Oh, from the A Song of Ice and Fire series...  
Alice: Just a very popular series of books from back home... never mind.  
\*_\*  
Alice\(sad\): But all of this is just conjecture. How will we be able to prove this?  
Therese\(angry\): I have a plan. And that's where you come in.

Alice\*Think: Perhaps she genuinely isn't aware that Armand has only platonic feelings for her...  
&gt;&gt;  
Alice: Anne...  
Anne\(sad\): Hmm?  
Alice: Have you ever tried speaking with Armand? To tell him about your feelings for him?  
Anne\(surprise\): Oh, I... Actually, no, I've never tried. Do you think I should?  
Alice: I think that you deserve to know where you stand with him.  
Alice: Whether he has romantic feelings for you... or not.  
Anne\(surprise\): I... You're right. I DO deserve to know!  
Anne\(sad\): But... but what if he tells me that he doesn't love me?  
Alice: At least you would know, once and for all.  
Alice: Anything's better than being stuck in a limbo like this, right?  
Alice: And you're young, and pretty... even if he doesn't love you, you must have plenty of other suitors, right?  
Anne\(surprise\): I do, actually.  
Anne: You know, I didn't expect you to tell me anything that would help...  
Message: Getting The Hint \| You gently persuaded Anne to speak with Armand!  
Anne: But you actually have. Who would have thought?  
Alice: Er, you're welcome.

**B**

Alice_Think: She needs to face the facts. It's not fair for either her or Armand.  
&gt;&gt;  
Alice: Anne...  
Anne\(sad\): Hmm?  
Alice: Don't you think it's time you stopped pining over someone who doesn't feel the same way for you?  
Anne\(surprise\): I...  
Anne\(angry\): {_Attention Excuse me???}  
Alice: I think you know deep down that Armand doesn't feel the same way for you.  
Alice: He's kind to you, but only because he sees you as a friend, maybe even a little sister.  
Alice: But his feelings for you are purely platonic. And deep down inside you know this.  
Alice: It's why you choose to sit and cry here by yourself, instead of speaking with him.  
Alice: You don't want to hear him telling you what you don't want to hear...  
Alice: Which is that he has no romantic feelings for you.  
&gt;&gt;&gt;  
Anne\(angry\): I... {_Attention How dare you!!}  
Alice\(surprise\): Have I said anything wrong?  
Anne_Shout\(angry\): Stop!!! Shut up!!!  
Alice: Come on, Anne. It's not fair for either you, or him, that you keep on being deluded this way.  
Narrator: She jumps to her feet and points a trembling finger at you.  
Anne\*Shout\(angry\): I... I want you to get out!!! Get out!!!  
&gt;&gt;  
Narrator: You stand up calmly.  
Alice: I will. But you know every word of what I'm saying is true.

**C**

Alice_Think: I'd better mind my own business.  
Alice_Think: She obviously won't want to hear anything from me, and besides...  
Alice_Think: This is something for Armand to tell her himself anyway.  
&gt;&gt;  
Anne\(sad\): I don't know why I told you all of that anyway.  
Alice: Maybe you just needed to talk about it. Do you feel better at least, after talking about it?  
Anne\(sad\): Not really, no.

**A**

Palace\_Guard1: I really couldn't tell you, miss.  
Alice: But-  
Palace\_Guard1: You'll have to ask him yourself.

**B**

Palace\_Guard1: I'm afraid so, miss. Lord Mazarin doesn't take no for an answer.  
Palace\_Guard1: If you don't come with me, I'm sure he'll send more guards for you.  
Alice: And what if I refuse then?  
Palace\_Guard1: I'm just trying to do my job, miss.

**C**

Palace\_Guard1: Perhaps he feels what he has to discuss with you is better done in the privacy of his study, miss.

**A**

Rene: Straight to the point, I see. Very good, I prefer it this way too.

**B**

Narrator: He smiles a humorless smile.  
Rene: Good question.

**C**

Rene: Neither Armand nor Philippe can help you now, I'm afraid.  
\*_\*  
Rene: You see, I've been doing some investigations on you.  
Rene: You appear from out of nowhere, without a feasible explanation...  
Alice\(sad\): I'm suffering from amnesia-  
Rene: Like I said, without a feasible explanation, and at a time when the king has just been gravely poisoned.  
Rene: You ingratiate yourself with the Duke and the Prince, you infiltrate the palace...  
Alice\(surprise\): {_Attention What??} I didn't infiltrate anything!  
Rene: Please let me finish.  
Rene: You have to admit, everything about you is suspicious.  
Rene: You can see why it was my duty to carry out investigations on who you really are.

Alice\(angry\): Alright. Who am I really, then? Since you seem to imply that you know.  
Rene: Oh, I do. Everything points to only one possible explanation...

Rene: You are a witch.  
Alice\(surprise\): **What??**

Rene: What an amazing expression of surprise!  
Rene: You could almost convince me that you're genuinely shocked.  
Rene: Or perhaps you were just not expecting that I would find out so soon.

Rene: Interesting, that's the first time I've heard that.

### C. I have no idea how I got there!

**A**

Rene: Really? Because I think YOU'RE lying. Robert has no reason to make up any of that.  
Rene: And the very fact that you're lying about it now, shows that you clearly have something nefarious to hide.  
Alice\(sad\): What?? It doesn't show anything!

**B**

Alice\(sad\): It's true that I was there, but I wasn't spying or anything that they were accusing me of doing!  
Rene: Really? So what WERE you doing there then?
