### A. Who are you??

### B. What are you doing in my room??

**A**

Anne\(angry\): Who am I?? Anybody who is anybody knows who I am.  
Alice\(angry\): Well, I don't know who you are.  
Anne\(angry\): That just proves my suspicions are right, that you're a nobody.  
Alice\(angry\): Excuse me??? Do you have any idea how rude you are being right now??  
Anne: Well, did I say something wrong?  
Anne: You're a nobody, pretending to be some kind of noblewoman...

**B**

&gt;&gt;  
Anne\(angry\): This ISN'T your room. This is a room in Armand's estate.  
Alice\(angry\): And I'm a guest in his estate.  
Anne\(angry\): Well, don't get too comfortable, because you'll be leaving soon!  
Alice\(angry\): Excuse me??  
Anne\(angry\): I'm going to make sure that Armand throws you out tomorrow!  
Alice\(sad\): Why would you do that?  
Anne\(angry\): You are obviously a fraud, pretending to be some kind of noblewoman...  
\*_\*  
&gt;&gt;&gt;  
Anne\(angry\): And taking advantage of Armand's hospitality to live off of him!  
Alice\(angry\): I'm nothing of that sort!  
Alice\(angry\): And that's rich, coming from somebody who came uninvited into my room...  
Alice_Shout\(angry\): To hurl insults and threats at me!  
Alice_Shout\(angry\): Just who are you anyway?  
&gt;&gt;  
Narrator: The woman draws herself up proudly, to her full height, and sneers at you.  
\_Anne Name Anne Mazarin

### A. Ouch, that hurt like a punch to the gut.

### B. I should've known he was too good to be true.

**A**

Narrator: You feel a physical pain in your chest, as the words leave her mouth.  
Alice\*Think\(sad\): Armand is engaged.

**B**

&gt;&gt;  
Alice\(angry\): But what were you doing in my room, in the middle of the night?  
Anne\(angry\): Well, what were you doing walking in the garden with Armand, in the middle of the night?  
Alice\(angry\): Okay firstly, I have every right to walk anywhere I want, with whoever I want.  
Alice: And secondly, you seem to have very little trust in your fiance...  
Alice: If you are jealous to the point that you have to ambush me in my room in order to interrogate me!  
Alice\(sad\): Which is super creepy, by the way.  
Anne\(surprise\): I... You...  
Alice: Cat got your tongue?  
Narrator: She takes two steps towards you, and stabs her finger at you.  
&gt;&gt;&gt;  
Anne\(angry\): You just stay away from Armand... or else.  
Alice\(angry\): Or else what?  
Anne: Or else, you'll see what I can do.  
Alice: If you're done threatening me, please leave.  
&gt;  
Narrator: She bites her lower lip, and clenches her fists furiously...  
Narrator: Then she stomps past you, bumping your shoulder hard...

Narrator: It is a few good seconds before your heart stops racing from the confrontation.

Alice_Think\(sad\): Wow... I can't believe that just happened.  
Alice_Think\(sad\): Can Armand really be engaged to marry such a woman?

## \(cd\_03\_03\_engaged\_to\_marry\)

### A. I thought that he would have better taste.

### B. Actually, I don't think I believe her.

**A**

Alice\*Think\(sad\): She's so horrid. Surely he can do better than her.

**B**

Alice_Think\(angry\): She must be making this up!  
Alice_Think\(sad\): If he was really engaged, he would have mentioned it... wouldn't he?

Jeanne\(surprise\): May I see it?  
Narrator: You hand your mobile phone to the curious handmaid, who picks it up gingerly.  
Alice: Yes. I was trying to find out what time it was, but the battery is dead.

Jeanne\(surprise\): "Magical object"?

Alice: To go on the internet...  
Jeanne: The "internet"?  
Alice: Yeah, it's a, um... a a global computer network.  
Alice: And we can also play games on it. Well, when the battery isn't dead, of course.  
Narrator: There is a long silence as she stares at you.  
Jeanne: Now you're just pulling my leg, aren't you?  
Alice: Alright, it's not really magic, but everything else is true.  
&gt;  
Narrator: She hands your phone back to you.  
Jeanne: I have no idea what any of that means, but okay.  
Alice: Jeanne, what time is it?

### A. That's ridiculous!

### B. She's right, I am a love rival.

**A**

Jeanne: Is it really?  
Narrator: The handmaid looks at you shrewdly.  
Jeanne: She may have her flaws, but she's very observant. And...

**B**

Jeanne\(happy\): You have no idea how happy it makes me to hear that!  
Alice\(shy\): Really?  
Jeanne: Yes. Perhaps his Lordship will finally be able to find his happiness soon.  
Jeanne: But with regards to her...  
\*_\*  
Narrator: She leans in closer to you, and her voice drops to a whisper.  
Jeanne: Lady Mazarin isn't averse to bending the truth to suit her.  
Narrator: Jeanne looks around nervously, as if checking that nobody else was in the room.

Narrator: Jeanne holds her chin, as she stares off to one side, thinking.  
Jeanne: But I wonder why she told you that...?  
&gt;&gt;

Narrator: She looks down at the bottom of your nightgown.  
Jeanne\(smile\): Is that why you have grass stains on your nightgown?

Jeanne: You are so nice, and his Lordship is an exemplary man who deserves nothing but happiness.  
Alice: Nothing happened, Jeanne. We merely spoke of serious matters.  
Jeanne: If you say so.  
Narrator: She waggles her eyebrows at you again, and the both of you burst out in laughter.  
&gt;  
Narrator: Suddenly, a thought occurs to you, which makes you sober up quickly.  
Alice\(sad\): Jeanne, is Anne staying here as well?  
Jeanne: Oh, no. Lady Mazarin lives in the Royal Palace.  
Jeanne: She's the daughter of the King's Royal Advisor, Rene Mazarin.  
Jeanne\(sad\): But whenever Armand is in Paris, she's more frequently here than not.  
Jeanne\(sad\): She had dinner here last night, and as it was getting late, stayed here for the night.  
Alice: I see. She must have looked out of her window and seen us walking in the garden...  
Alice\(sad\): And then decided to come and warn me to stay away from Armand.  
Jeanne: Wow, that's so uncalled for. Although, certainly not out of character for her...  
Alice: What do you mean?

Narrator: Jeanne squares her shoulders, and nods.  
Jeanne: Okay, I know I can trust you anyway.  
Alice: You definitely can trust me.  
Jeanne: Last year, when his Lordship was in Paris...  
Jeanne: Madame Montfort and her daughter, Lady Isabelle de Montfort, came to visit him.  
Jeanne: Madame Montfort had the intention to introduce Lady Isabelle to his Lordship...  
Jeanne: I believe in the hopes that his Lordship might take a liking to her, and maybe propose marriage.  
Jeanne: I know that Lady Isabelle fell for his Lordship as soon as they were introduced.  
Alice: Why am I not surprised.  
Jeanne: Yes, there are many young ladies who dream of winning his Lordship's affections...  
Jeanne: Since he is young, good-looking, extremely rich, and a Duke.  
Jeanne: Anyway, Lady Anne of course found out about it, and insisted on staying here as well, during that time.  
Jeanne: One night, there was a tremendous scandal...  
Jeanne: Such that Madame Montfort and Lady Isabelle had to leave Paris immediately the next morning.  
&gt;&gt;  
Jeanne\(sad\): To this day, they have never returned...

Alice\(surprise\): {_Attention **What???**}  
Jeanne\(sad\): Shhh!  
Alice\(surprise\): But why on earth did she do that, if she had fallen for Armand, and wanted to win his affections?  
Jeanne\(sad\): Apparently, Lady Anne told Lady Isabelle that his Lordship had asked her to pass a message to her...  
Jeanne\(sad\): That he would visit her in her chamber that night, and to dismiss her handmaid for the night.  
Jeanne\(sad\): Lady Anne also convinced Lady Isabelle that it was his Lordship's wish...  
Jeanne\(sad\): That she wear a blindfold when she was in bed that evening.  
Jeanne\(sad\): Oh, and not to let her mother Madame Montfort know about this, of course.  
&gt;&gt;  
Alice\(sad\): Oh no, I see where this is headed...  
Jeanne\(sad\): Lady Isabelle, who was eighteen, rather gullible of nature...  
Jeanne\(sad\): And eager to believe that the Duke of Villeroy fancied her back, swallowed every word.  
Jeanne\(sad\): And she did receive a male visitor that night...  
Jeanne\(sad\): It just wasn't his Lordship, of course.  
Alice\(surprise\): But who was it?  
Jeanne\(sad\): It could have been anyone that Lady Anne had hired.  
Jeanne\(sad\): In the middle of the night, Lady Anne woke up the entire household.  
Jeanne\(sad\): She said that she had heard strange noises coming from the direction of Lady Isabelle's chamber...  
Jeanne\(sad\): That she had gone with her handmaid to investigate if Lady Isabelle was alright...  
Jeanne\(sad\): And that they had both come upon Lady Isabelle in bed with a strange man...  
Jeanne\(sad\): Who immediately fled upon being discovered.  
Alice\(sad\): Oh my god...  
Jeanne\(sad\): Of course, Lady Isabelle's reputation was completely ruined.
