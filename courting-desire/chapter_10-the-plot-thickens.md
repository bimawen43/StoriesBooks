Alice_Think\(surprise\): Wait! **Are they talking about me???**  
Narrator: Armand and you exchange equally shocked glances. He seems to have come to the same conclusion as you.  
Narrator: He raises a finger to his lips, indicating that you should both keep quiet. You nod in agreement.  
Narrator: You both continue listening...  
Narrator_Top: Female Voice \| Calm down, Father.  
Narrator: Your eyes widen as you recognize the voices... it's Marie and Rene Mazarin!  
Narrator_Top: Marie \| Philippe and I will be married in Spring. What's there to worry about?  
Narrator_Top: Rene \| I worry, Marie, because it wasn't an easy thing to arrange, and there's a lot riding on it.  
&gt;&gt;R  
Alice_Think\(surprise\): 'A lot riding on it?'  
&gt;R  
Narrator_Top: Rene \| And despite your best attempts, it seems as if you still haven't managed to win over his heart yet.  
Narrator_Top: Rene \| You need to get a firmer grip on him.  
Narrator_Top: Marie \| I don't get anyway why you want me to marry him so badly.

Narrator: They start walking further away, and their voices start to fade away...

Alice: And that part where he said 'there's a lot riding on it'...  
Armand: You're right. We need to look more into this.

**B**

Armand: Match-making is the norm here, though. Is it not in the future?  
Alice\(smile\): No, it isn't done anymore, except in certain more backward cultures and countries.  
Armand\(surprise\): That's interesting. Do you mean to say that everybody gets married for love?

Armand: 'Gold-diggers'?  
Alice\(smile\): Um, people who get married for money.  
Narrator: He laughs.  
Armand\(happy\): Ahh... but here that's the reason people get married, half of the time.  
Armand\(smile\): The other half would be for social standing.

Armand: Yes, maybe.

Alice: Has Rene tried to match-make Anne to you?  
Armand: No.

Armand: You don't think that he should?  
Alice\(angry\): Well, she's fake, manipulative, and she may have tried to kill me.

Armand\(sad\): And I've known her since we were children.  
Alice\(sad\): Of course... I understand.  
Alice: It's a delicate position, and you're just trying to be a gentleman.  
Armand: But I will talk to her. In the meantime, with regards to what we've just heard...
