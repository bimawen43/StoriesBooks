Armand: It's most uncommon for a young lady to be found wandering alone in public without a chaperone.

Alice*Think: Let's see how this nightgown looks like.  
Narrator: You walk over to the fancy looking armoire that Jeanne had indicated to you earlier on, and open the wooden doors.  
Narrator: A white linen nightgown is hanging inside, and you take it out and put it on.

Alice*Think(sad): It's no good... I can't fall asleep!  
Alice*Think(sad): It's too stuffy in here, maybe some fresh air will make me feel better.  
Narrator: Pushing the thick quilt away from you, you get up, walk over to the window, and open the shutters.  
Narrator: Moonlight trickles in the room, and you immediately feel better as the cool night air washes over your face.  
Narrator: You look out of your window...

Narrator: The moon is full tonight, bathing the garden in soft moonlight.  
Narrator: Suddenly, to your surprise you see a figure strolling in the garden below...  
Alice*Think(surprise): Who could be walking in the garden at this time?  
Narrator: You watch curiously as the figure gradually strolls nearer towards you...  
Narrator: You make out his brown, tousled curls, and the sharp, handsome features of his face...  
Alice*Think(surprise): It's Armand! What is he doing out there??  
Alice*Think: Ugh, so not only is he totally gorgeous, and a hero...  
Alice*Think: But he's also charming and mysterious??  
Narrator: As you keep looking at him, you see him sigh, and frown deeply.  
Alice*Think: I have to find out what he's doing down there!

Narrator: Finding the door to the garden unlocked, you leave the house and walk into the garden, which is gently lit by the full moon.  
Narrator: Although it is generally quiet, you can faintly hear the sound of crickets chirping...  
Narrator: And the night air is sweet with the smell of roses and honeysuckle.  
Narrator: The air is cool, though, and quickly raises goosebumps on your arms...  
Narrator: As you walk slowly towards where you last saw Armand standing.  
Alice*Think(sad): Brr! Maybe I should have brought a shawl.

Armand(surprise): {Alice Name}?

Armand(surprise): What are you doing here?  
Alice(shy): Umm... I couldn't sleep, so I decided to come out for a stroll, and some air.  
Armand: Ah, I see. It's hardly surprising that you can't fall asleep... Considering the day that you've had.  
Alice: What about you? Are you here because you couldn't sleep either?  
Armand: Yes. I find that a small stroll usually helps me to clear my mind, whenever this happens.  
\>  
Narrator: He looks away, and his brows draw together again in a frown, like you saw him do before from your window.  
Alice: Armand...  
# (cd_02_10_armands_thinking)  
## A. Is everything alright?  
## B. Are you worried about something?  
#### A  
Narrator: Armand is silent for a while, then he sighs.  
Armand(sad): No, actually something is very wrong.  
Alice(surprise): Oh! What's wrong?  
#### B  
Armand(sad): Is it that obvious?  
Alice: Well... yes.  
Alice: Armand, you can tell me whatever it is that you're worried about.  
\***  
Alice: I mean, if you don't mind telling me.  
Narrator: Armand runs his hand through his hair again.  
Alice*Think: He always does that when he's thinking about something...  
Armand(sad): I don't want to burden you with it, especially when you are already worried enough about your own situation...  
Alice: I can't sleep anyway, let me lend a listening ear.  
Narrator: Armand looks away, and is quiet for a few seconds.  
Narrator: Then, he seems to make up his mind, and turns back to face you.  
Armand: I don't live in Paris all year long, I have a country house in Bordeaux; that is normally where I live.  
Alice: I see. Jeanne mentioned that this is the Hotel du Villeroy...  
Armand: It's my estate. I stay here whenever I come to visit Paris.  
Armand: I like to visit my childhood friends sometimes... Philippe, and Louis, his Majesty the King.  
Alice(surprise): Oh!  
Alice*Think(surprise): If I recall correctly, Philippe's the other guy in that painting... the brother of the King!  
Armand(sad): Unfortunately, it's a tragic event that brings me here this time.  
Alice(sad): What happened?  
Armand(sad): Louis is deathly ill.  
Alice(sad): Oh my God!  
Armand(sad): Philippe wrote a letter to me, bidding me to return to Paris urgently. I just arrived two days ago, in fact.  
Armand(sad): I've visited two days in a row now.  
Armand(sad): Louis is bed-ridden, but at least he doesn't seem to be getting any worse at the moment.  
Alice(sad): What's wrong with him? Is he sick?  
Narrator: The expression on Armand's face darkens as he frowns angrily, and he clenches his fists in anger.  
Armand(angry): The royal physician suspects poison.  
Alice(surprise): <i><b>Poison!</b></i> How horrible!  
Alice*Think(sad): Oh my God, and Justine was just telling me how Kings and Queens frequently died young...  
Alice*Think(sad): One of the main causes being assassinations!  
Alice(sad): No wonder you can't sleep. You must all be worried sick.  
Armand(sad): The worst thing is...  
Narrator: He stops himself, just as it seemed as he was about to confide something further to you.  
\>>  
Armand(sad): Never mind. I should not burden you with court politics and plot intrigues.  
Armand: It is late, and you should get some rest.

Narrator: For a while, you stroll in silence, the quiet night air only broken by the sound of the crickets chirping.  
Narrator: He leads you to a little wooden bench, just beside a small, pretty pond, and the both of you take a seat, facing the pond.  
Narrator: The moonlight glints off the surface of the water, making the water look like it's sparkling with stars.  
Alice: What were you about to tell me earlier?  
Narrator: He frowns again, clearly upset, before speaking again in a low voice.  
Armand(sad): The worst thing is, if the court physician is right, and it was indeed poison...  
Armand(sad): The one to benefit the most from the King dying...  
Armand(sad): Would be his brother Philippe, since he's next in line to the throne.  
Narrator: Armand clenches his fists in anger.  
Armand(angry): But it's most certainly not Philippe!  
Armand(sad): Philippe would never do something like this.  
Armand(sad): I grew up with both Louis and Philippe, and I know them well.  
Armand(sad): They love each other dearly, in fact...  
Armand(sad): Philippe would lay down his life for his brother without hesitation, if Louis was in danger.  
Armand(sad): Philippe also has never had any desire to be King.  
Armand(sad): He detests court affairs, and all the responsibilities that come with being King.  
Alice(sad): I see...  
Armand(sad): But because he's next in line to inherit the throne...  
Armand(sad): There are now rumors growing in the Court that he could have poisoned his brother.  
Alice(sad): Oh no!  
Armand: That's why I'm here, aside from visiting Louis who is very ill.  
Armand(angry): I want to help to get to the bottom of this, and find out who was really behind the assassination attempt!  
Alice(smile): And clear Philippe's name! That's very admirable of you.  
Alice: Do you have any idea who it might be?  
Armand: Not right now, but I only just arrived two days ago.  
Armand: It's not that easy to try to assassinate a King by poison.  
Armand: Louis has numerous food tasters who taste everything first, before he eats or drink it.  
Armand: So only somebody very high up in Court, and very close to him, could have had the chance to do this.  
Alice: I see.  
Narrator: The both of you fall quiet again; Armand seemingly lost in his thoughts...  
Narrator: You just content to sit there, conscious of his presence beside you on the park bench.  
Narrator: Finally, he turns to face you.
