Justine: No idea, but they're both hot.

Narrator: The both of you lock eyes and giggle.  
Alice: They are very hot.  
Justine: Actually, the descriptions usually name the people in the paintings starting from the left to the right...  
Justine: So the handsome blond with those piercing blue eyes should be Philippe...  
Justine: And the gorgeous, dark haired, green eyed one should be Armand.  
Justine: Which one do you prefer?  
Alice\(shy\): I think...

## \(cd\_01\_06\_men\_in\_the\_painting\)

### A. The blond one is really handsome.

### B. The dark haired one is hotter.

### C. Both are just as hot, it's impossible to choose one!

Alice\(happy\): Yes, Justine, I know. He's blond and has blue eyes just like your boyfriend.  
Narrator: Justine waggles her eyebrows mischievously.

**B**

Justine: Why do you think Armand is hotter?  
Alice\(shy\): I like the tall, dark and handsome type.  
Justine\(smile\): Ahh, I prefer the blond prince, but yeah I agree, the Duke is hot too.

Narrator: Suddenly, you hear a sound in the distance...  
Narrator: The sound of hooves galloping, getting louder, and nearer...  
Narrator: A man on horseback rides up, his white horse kicking up dirt... and comes to a full stop directly beside you.

Armand: What is this commotion?  
Narrator: He looks at the men grabbing you by your arms, and his brows draw together in a frown.  
Armand: Are these people harassing you?  
Alice\(sad\): Yes!  
Narrator: The nobleman's expression becomes very stern, as he faces the two thugs.  
Armand\(angry\): Unhand the lady. Now.  
Alice\(sad\): Yeah, let go of me!  
Harrasser1\(angry\): What?? This is none of your business!  
Armand\(angry\): I am afraid a maiden being harassed is my business.  
Narrator: Furious, the two thugs turn to fully face the stern nobleman.  
Harrasser1\(angry\): You really want to mess with us?  
Harrasser2\(angry\): You want to play hero, huh? We're going to kill you!  
Narrator: The nobleman draws a sword and points it at them!  
Armand\(angry\): Not if I kill you first.  
Narrator: His sword glints in the sunlight, looking particularly sharp, and deadly.  
Narrator: The two thugs all take a hasty step back, their faces turning pale.  
Armand\(angry\): Now get lost, before I skewer the two of you like the pigs that you are.  
Harrasser2\(sad\): Screw it, I didn't sign up for this!  
Harrasser1\(sad\): Damn it! Run!  
Narrator: The both of you watch as the two thugs scramble away hastily, swearing loudly.  
Alice_Think\(surprise\): I can't believe what just happened!  
Alice_Think: I'm so lucky this person came to help me, just at this moment.  
Alice_Think: I have to thank him!  
Narrator: You turn to face the nobleman, who is still on horseback.  
&gt;&gt;  
Alice: Thank you so much. I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't come to my rescue.  
&gt;  
Narrator: With a graceful motion, the nobleman dismounts from his horse, and hands the reins to one of his men.  
Narrator: Then, he turns to face you fully.  
Narrator: The first thing that strikes you is how tall, and well built he is.  
Narrator: Even his fine, expensive looking clothes can't hide his strong, but lean body.  
Narrator: His tousled, dark brown, wavy hair frames the most handsome face you have ever seen...  
Narrator: His features are strong and defined, his cheekbones so chiseled, it could have cut glass.  
Narrator: His eyes, a mesmerizing emerald green, crinkles up with concern as he gazes gently back at you.  
Alice\(surprise\): YOU!  
Armand: Are you alright, mademoiselle?

### A. I... I recognize you!

\*_\*  
Alice\(surprise\): You're the man in the painting!  
Narrator: The stranger frowns slightly in a good natured bewilderment...  
Narrator: Then, he grins, the smile transforming his handsome face into something quite divine.  
Armand\(smile\): I know not of this painting that you mention, but...  
\_Armand Name Armand  
Armand\(smile\): I am Armand.
