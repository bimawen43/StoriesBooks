Narrator: You are all gathered in the salon in the Royal Palace, where Philippe has just unveiled a painting...  
Narrator: Of a girl that looks exactly like you!  
Armand\(sad\): So the reason you painted this is because...  
Philippe: I wanted to find her.  
Narrator: Everybody turns to look at you.  
Alice\(surprise\): How?  
Philippe: By painting her likeness, and then having several footmen out looking for her.  
Narrator: He shrugs lightly, as if embarrassed by having said that.  
&gt;&gt;  
Alice\(smile\): Oh! Like Prince Charming looking for Cinderella using the glass slipper!  
Philippe\(surprise\): I beg your pardon?  
Alice: Umm, never mind.  
Alice: So... I don't suppose you've had any luck finding this... dream girl?  
Narrator: Philippe stares at you thoughtfully.

&gt;&gt;  
Alice\(sad\): I understand that me suddenly showing up here, like this, looks strange...  
Alice\(sad\): Especially in times like this.  
Alice\(sad\): But I don't have any "ulterior motives". I just want to find my way back home.  
Therese\(sad\): Oh! But of course, my poor girl!

Alice_Think\(sad\): If I try to say anything, it will only make matters worse.

Armand\(angry\): And what "ulterior motives" might this young girl have, pray tell?

Rene: Perhaps she's a spy, sent here to report back to whoever sent her.  
Rene\(angry\): Perhaps she's an assassin...

Narrator: Therese gasps.  
Armand\(angry\): You are reaching, sir, with these far-fetched and ridiculous accusations.  
Armand\(angry\): Just so you know, she didn't even plan on being here.  
Armand\(angry\): It was **I** who insisted that she come into my charge, as I was worried for her safety...  
Armand\(angry\): Upon witnessing her being attacked by thugs in broad daylight.

Louis: That's quite enough.

Louis\(smile\): I want them to stay longer, I can rest later.

Narrator: Henri gesticulates wildly, then resumes looking sad in silence.  
Louis\(surprise\): What is the matter?  
Narrator: Henri points to his throat, and gesticulates some more.  
Philippe: It seems like Henri has... laryngitis and cannot sing?  
Narrator: Henri nods his head sadly.  
Therese\(sad\): Oh no!  
Louis: Oh, well... Can you at least play music?  
Louis: Or do you have arthritis and cannot play as well?

Louis: Maybe one of you can sing?  
Alice\(surprise\): That's funny, that tune has the same chords as the chorus of La Vie En Rose...!  
Narrator: Unconsciously, you start humming along to it.  
Louis\(surprise\): Do you know this song?  
Alice: Oh, not exactly, it just sounds a little like another song that I know...  
Louis\(smile\): Oh, then will you not sing? I would like that very much!  
Alice\(surprise\): Me? Oh no, I couldn't-  
Louis\(smile\): What if someone else were to sing with you?  
Therese\(smile\): Yes! Perhaps you can sing a duet, with Armand, or Philippe!  
Narrator: Both men turn and smile at you.  
Philippe\(smile\): I wouldn't mind at all.  
Armand\(smile\): It would be my pleasure.  
Alice\(shy\): Oh! But... I'm afraid I don't know any of your songs.  
Philippe\(smile\): I can teach you a simple one...  
Armand\(smile\): Or you can teach me a song that you know.
