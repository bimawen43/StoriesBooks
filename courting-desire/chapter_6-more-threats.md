Narrator: The two sisters have just cornered you in the King's antechamber!  
&gt;&gt;  
Marie\(angry\): **Stay away from my fiance!**  
Alice\(surprise\): Philippe is your fiance?  
&gt;&gt;&gt;  
Marie\(angry\): You heard me!  
&gt;  
Alice: Okay...

## \(cd\_06\_01\_the\_other\_fiance\)

### A. Is this another fake engagement?

### B. I don't see what that's got to do with me.

**A**

Alice: Are you engaged to him, the way Anne is "engaged" to Armand?  
Narrator: You see Anne blushing furiously out of the corner of your eye.  
Anne\(angry\): Shut up!  
Narrator: Marie laughs humorlessly.  
&gt;&gt;  
Marie: I don't know what Anne told you about her and Armand...  
Marie: But rest assured that I'm not making this up.  
&gt;&gt;&gt;  
Marie: Philippe and I are indeed engaged to be married, next spring.  
&gt;&gt;  
Marie: In fact, the King and Queen themselves have given us their blessing.  
Marie: We're planning the details of the wedding, right now.  
Alice\(sad\): Oh.

**B**

Marie: Are you denying that you have designs on Philippe?  
Alice: I don't need to deny or confirm anything to you.  
Alice: Just curious, do you and your sister both feel threatened by me?  
Narrator: Both Marie and Anne flush bright red with anger.  
&gt;&gt;  
Anne\(angry\): Threatened by YOU?? Certainly not!  
Alice: Well, that's good then. Since you're not even really engaged to Armand.  
Anne\(angry\): Shut up!  
Alice: Did I say something wrong?  
Marie: Everything about you is wrong.  
\*\*\*  
&gt;  
Marie: And I don't appreciate harlots like you throwing themselves at my fiance.  
Alice\(angry\): Excuse me, **harlot**?

## \(cd\_06\_02\_harlot\)

### A. I didn't throw myself at him.

### B. Philippe is coming on to me.

### C. Oh, it is on.

**A**

Alice\(angry\): And I don't appreciate having accusations like that thrown at me.  
Marie: You can deny all you want, I can see what you're up to.  
&gt;&gt;  
Alice\(angry\): Oh? And what am I up to?  
&gt;  
Marie: You obviously have ulterior motives on Armand AND Philippe.  
Marie: You're a gold digger.

**B**

Alice\(angry\): Please get your facts right.  
Narrator: Marie's cheeks flush red, but she smiles.  
Marie\(smile\): You think a Prince is throwing himself at a nobody like you?  
Marie\(smile\): Why, that's like saying someone is tired of eating caviar, and wants to eat onions instead.  
Alice\(angry\): I'm not an onion!

**C**

Marie\(surprise\): On? What's on?  
Anne\(surprise\): What's on what?  
Alice\(angry\): Never mind.  
\*_\*  
Narrator: You're so angry, you can feel yourself shaking... But you take a deep breath.  
&gt;&gt;  
Alice\(angry\): Look, this is absolutely ridiculous.  
Marie\(angry\): What?  
Alice: That both of you are telling me to stay away from "your men".  
Alice: You know what I think?  
Alice: If you're so insecure, perhaps they aren't yours to begin with.  
Anne\(angry\): Gasp! You... you...  
&gt;  
Alice: Did I hit a nerve?  
Narrator: The angry woman draws herself up haughtily, looking down her nose at you.  
Marie\(angry\): Just stay away from my Prince, otherwise...  
&gt;&gt;&gt;  
Marie\(angry\): Bad things could happen to you.  
&gt;&gt;

Narrator: The two sisters snicker behind their fans.  
Narrator: Marie yawns in an exaggerated manner.  
Marie: I grow tired of this conversation.  
Anne: I agree. Nothing more boring than peasants.  
Marie: I really think that you should leave.  
Anne: Yeah, stop hanging around here like some lost puppy. Nobody wants you here.  
&gt;  
Alice\(angry\): You know what? I got it.  
Narrator: Fighting back angry tears, you spin around and run towards the door.  
Anne: Don't let the door hit you on the way out!  
Narrator: As you run out into the hallway, you hear the sisters laughing at you.

Alice\(surprise\): Then why-  
Philippe\(sad\): It was Lord Mazarin who persuaded Louis to arrange for myself to marry Marie.  
Philippe\(sad\): That she would be a good match for me, being young, pretty, and of noble birth.  
Narrator: He smiles cynically.  
Philippe: Louis agreed, thinking that it would do me good to settle down with somebody.

Narrator: Both men are deep in conversation, and haven't noticed you.  
Alice_Think\(surprise\): They look... agitated?  
Narrator: You see Armand run his hand through his hair in that familiar sign of frustration...  
Narrator: As Philippe turns around and punches the hedge angrily!  
Alice_Think\(surprise\): Oh my god! What's happening??  
Alice_Think\(sad\): They seem really upset...  
Alice_Think\(sad\): What could they be talking about??  
Alice_Think: This looks serious, I definitely need to find out what's happening!

### A. Had to get away from Anne and Marie.

### B. Needed some fresh air.

**A**

Narrator: At your words, Philippe bursts into laughter, as Armand tries in vain to suppress a grin.  
&gt;&gt;  
Armand\(smile\): They are something, aren't they?  
Philippe\(smile\): I would have done the same.

**B**

&gt;&gt;  
Philippe\(smile\): Is "fresh air" the code words for "avoid the Mazarin sisters", now?  
Narrator: You try in vain to suppress a grin.  
Alice\(smile\): Maybe.

Alice: Anyway, I wanted to ask you if everything was alright, too.  
Alice: I couldn't help but notice that you both seemed upset.  
Narrator: They both stop smiling.  
Philippe: It's just... a really shitty time.  
Alice: Is it because of the King's health?  
Philippe\(sad\): Yes.

&gt;&gt;  
Philippe: So you know that not only was Louis poisoned...  
Philippe\(sad\): There's gossip in the Court that I was the one who tried to kill him?  
Alice\(sad\): Yes, Armand told me that too.

**B**

Armand: I've told her that the Physician suspects poisoning...  
Armand: But not the other thing.  
Alice\(surprise\): What other thing?  
Narrator: Philippe takes a deep breath and turns back to you.  
Philippe: Lady {Alice Name}...  
Philippe: We haven't discovered who attempted to poison Louis yet.  
Alice: Okay.  
Philippe: Think about it.  
Philippe: Usually the culprit is someone who stands to gain from the murder, right?  
Alice: That makes sense...  
Alice: Wait, so, if King Louis dies...  
Alice: The person who would stand to gain the most would be...  
&gt;&gt;&gt;  
Philippe\(sad\): Me.  
Narrator: You stare at him in shock.  
Philippe\(sad\): I would be the new King.  
Armand: Because Louis and Therese don't have a son yet.  
&gt;&gt;  
Alice_Think\(sad\): Oh my god... No wonder they're so upset!  
Alice\(sad\): So people think that you did it?  
Armand\(sad\): Just some rumors floating around in Court for now... But the rumors are growing.
