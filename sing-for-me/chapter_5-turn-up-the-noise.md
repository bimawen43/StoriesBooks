Narrator: The next time Kylie spins close to you, you pull her in and press your lips to hers!  
\>>>  
\*Kylie REL +1  
Kylie(shy): Oh. {Avery Name}...  
Narrator: Blushing, she glances around at the crowded dance floor.  
Avery(shy): I couldn't help myself. You look so beautiful right now.  
Narrator: Several men who'd been eyeing Kylie start to move away, glaring at you.  
Kylie(shy): Do it again.  
\>  
Narrator: Smiling, Kylie presses her body against yours, still swaying to the beat.  
Narrator: When you kiss her, the crowded nightclub seems to fall away until it's just the two of you...  
# sfm05_hear_song  
Narrator: Suddenly, the song changes to something familiar.  
Narrator*Top: Music | <color=purple><i>♬ I don't wanna waste another heartbeat... ♬</i></color>  
Kylie(smile): Hey, isn't this...?  
Avery(smile): {*Joyful One of Lucas's songs!}  
Narrator: A loud squeal cuts through the music. You see a woman jumping up and down in excitement.  
Fangirl(happy): {*Joyful Omigod, <i>Lucas Lucky!</i> I've been requesting this song all night!}  
Fanboy(happy): You know that part in the music video where he blows a kiss to the camera?  
Fangirl(happy): {*Joyful Um, <i>yes!</i> Totally swoon-worthy!}  
Narrator: You glance at Kylie and raise your eyebrows.  
\>>  
Avery(surprise): Okay, this is just weird.  
Kylie: Why? You knew he has fans, right?  
Avery(confuse): Yeah, but seeing them in person is a whole different story!  
\>  
Narrator: Curious, you turn your attention back to Lucas's fans.  
Fanboy(smile): So, are you going tomorrow night?  
Fangirl(angry): <i>Duh!</i> You think I'd miss seeing my baby's concert?  
Fanboy(happy): I heard it's sold out. {*Joyful But I got my ticket already!}  
Narrator: Kylie grabs your arm, and you tear your eyes away from the fans.  
\>>  
Kylie(happy): Hey, you didn't tell me that Lucas has a concert tomorrow!  
Avery(surprise): I didn't know.  
Kylie(surprise): Didn't you spend all day with him in the recording studio?  
Avery(sad): Yeah. He... didn't mention it.  
Kylie(sad): {Avery Name}, if you and Lucas are as close as you say you are...  
Kylie(sad): Why would he keep this from you?
