Barry(happy): <b>Lucas Lucky's manager</b>. I handle the business side of things.  
Avery: Okay... and why do you want to talk to me?  
Narrator: He looks a bit deflated at your lack of reaction.  
Barry: It's come to my attention that Lucas has taken an interest in you.  
Avery: I mean... we just had dinner together.  
Barry: Are you saying that he doesn't intend to see you again?  
Avery: Well, he did give me his number.  
Barry(surprise): His personal number? I've told him before that all calls should go through management first.  
Avery(confuse): That seems a bit controlling...  
Barry: Necessary precaution. Which is exactly what we need to discuss.

Avery: Actually, I'd never even heard of him before.  
Barry(surprise): Really? Well, his online persona is <i>essential</i> to his continued success.  
Barry: We've worked hard to build up his fan base through livestreams and social media posts.  
Barry(happy): It was a stroke of genius on my part. His fans feel like they have a personal connection now.  
Avery: Not really seeing where I come into this...  
Barry: I'll cut to the chase, then. Lucas's fans can be a bit... <b>possessive</b>.  
Avery(surprise): Possessive? Like, they think they own him?  
\>>  
Barry: I wouldn't put it in such coarse terms, but...  
Barry: It's essential to keep that illusion alive for them.  
Avery(sad): You mean you <b>want</b> to pander to their fantasies about Lucas?  
Barry (happy): Yes, well, they pay our bills. Gotta keep 'em happy.  
Narrator: Barry chuckles, then trails off with a little cough when he sees that you're not joining in.

Avery(angry): Not what, rich? A celebrity?  
Barry: You're NOT the type of person Lucas is usually seen with, no.  
Avery(angry): And that somehow makes me unworthy?  
#### B  
Avery(angry): You're presuming a lot right now.  
Barry: Relationship, friendship, whatever you want to call it... It can't happen.

Barry: This is the way it has to be, I'm afraid. It's just business.  
Avery(sad): So you expect me to, what... cut ties with Lucas? Never see him again?  
Barry: If you knew what was best for both him and you, that's exactly what you'd do.  
Barry: Think about it, {Avery Name}... Do you really see yourself fitting into his life?

Barry: There's a dark side to fame. Before you know it, you're in too deep and there's no way out.

Avery(surprise): What's this?  
Barry: A contract. Sign along the dotted line, please.  
Narrator: Frowning, you skim over the first few paragraphs...  
Avery: <i>'The signer agrees to keep all correspondence and relations...</i>  
Avery: <i>... with the aforementioned party strictly confidential'</i>...  
Avery(surprise): You want me to keep my relationship with Lucas secret?  
Barry: A necessary precaution. Like I said, this is for your own protection.  
Avery(angry): Really? 'Cause it seems to me like this is for your benefit.  
Barry: That's part of it, of course. Lucas has an image he needs to uphold.  
Avery: And what does Lucas think about this? Does he approve?  
Narrator: Barry hesitates, and you narrow your eyes.

Avery(angry): You didn't tell him.

Avery(surprise): You think I'm not taking this seriously?  
Sam(sad): How could you? You have no idea what it's like to be in his shoes.  
Sam(angry): If you did, you'd stay away from him. He's better off without you.  
Narrator: Sam turns to follow Lucas through the doors...  
Avery(angry): Wait.  
Narrator: You reach out and grab his arm, forcing him to look at you.  
Avery(angry): What's your problem? I'm sick of you treating me like this.  
Sam(angry): I don't know what youâ€”  
Avery(angry): No, you're not getting away that easily. It's time for us to talk it out, face to face...  
Avery(angry): Tell me why you hate me so much.
