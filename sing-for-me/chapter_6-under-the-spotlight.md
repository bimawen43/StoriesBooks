Lucas(happy): All I hear is the music. It's an amazing high.  
Avery: You must be exhausted. You were going pretty hard up there.  
Lucas: Honestly, <i>this</i> is the hardest part. I'm always so keyed up after a concert...

Narrator: Kylie melts against you, deepening the kiss as you bury your fingers in her hair.  
\>>>  
Kylie(pleasure): I don't think I'll ever get tired of this.  
Avery(smile): You say that now...  
Avery(shy): But won't you get sick of me smothering you with affection?  
Narrator: Kylie giggles as you kiss her again and again, moving from her lips to her cheek to her neck.  
Kylie(shy): Nope. You'll have to try harder than that.  
Avery(smile): Trust me, I'm just getting started.  
Narrator: Your kisses quickly change from playful to passionate...  
Narrator: Kylie gasps as you let your hands trail down her spine, settling on her hips.  
Kylie(shy): {Avery Name}... we should probably...  
Avery: Slow down... I know...  
Narrator: You speak between kisses, neither of you making any move to stop.  
Kylie(shy): Lucas could be back any minute...  
Avery(shy): Just one more kiss...  
\>>  
Narrator: When you finally pull away from each other, both of you are breathless.

Avery(shy): What do you say, should we sample some more of these gifts?  
Kylie(smile): If anyone asks, we'll just say we're Lucas's taste testers.  
\>  
Narrator: Some time later, both of you are sitting on the floor.  
Narrator: Chocolate wrappers and fruit baskets are strewn out around you in messy piles.  
Avery(happy): I'm starting to see the perks of being a celebrity.  
Kylie(happy): Seriously. Where are <i>my</i> adoring fans?  
Avery(shy): You know...

## A. You'd go mad with power.  
## B. <i>I'm</i> your biggest fan.  
#### A  
Kylie(smile): Who, <i>me?</i>  
Kylie(smile): But I'm so humble and down-to-earth!  
Narrator: You pointedly stare at the ribbon she's tied around her head like a crown.  
Avery(smile): Uh huh. And I'm an alien from Mars.  
Kylie(smile): You know, that would actually explain a lot--  
Narrator: You smack her arm, both of you dissolving into laughter.  
#### B  
\*Kylie REL +1  
Kylie(smile): Aww, then you must be so excited to be here with me!  
Avery(smile): Can't you tell I'm giddy?  
Kylie(happy): I don't usually do this, but for my biggest fan...  
Kylie(smile): Want to take a selfie?  
Avery(smile): Oh my god, a selfie with <i>the</i> Kylie Walsh? No way!  
Narrator: Giggling, Kylie pulls out her phone and poses with a smile.  
\>>  
Kylie(smile): Say cheese!  
Narrator: Next to her, you clap your hands to your face in an expression of overwhelmed excitement.  
Avery(surprise): ...

Narrator: Kylie pulls the photo up for you to see, and you both dissolve into laughter.  
Kylie(happy): This is definitely my new lock screen.  
\***  
Narrator: When you've both eaten your fill, you look around at the mess you've made.  
Avery: We should probably clean this up before Lucas gets back.  
Kylie(happy): Doesn't he have people for that?  
Avery(happy): Probably. But if we want tickets to his next concert...  
Kylie(happy): Okay, okay, I'm cleaning.  
Narrator: You set to work straightening the dressing room.  
Narrator: The closer you look at the fan gifts, the stranger they seem. Giant teddy bears, a massage wand...  
Avery(surprise): Uh, is this a lock of human hair?  
Kylie(sad): Ew! I retract my earlier statement. I'm good without adoring fans.  
Avery(happy): Even if they'd give you dozens of roses?  
Narrator: You lift up a beautiful bouquet, and Kylie's eyes brighten.  
\>>  
Kylie(shy): So pretty!  
Avery(smile)*Think: I should...  
# (sfm_06_10_C_DP3_rose_bouquet)

#### A  
Narrator: You pluck one of the roses from the bouquet, presenting it to Kylie with a bow.  
Avery(smile): For you, my lady.  
\*Kylie REL +1  
Kylie(happy): Well aren't you smooth?  
Narrator: Grinning, she takes the rose and tucks it behind her ear.  
Kylie(smile): How do I look?  
Avery(smile): Like a vision.  
Kylie: You don't think Lucas will mind...?  
Avery(smile): I think he can spare one rose out of a dozen.  
Avery(smile): Besides, it suits you.  
#### B  
Avery: Sorry, but since you've rejected this lifestyle...  
Narrator: With a shrug, you hold the roses over a trash bin.  
Kylie(surprise): No! What did those flowers ever do to you?  
Narrator: Kylie lunges at you, but you're already placing them back on the tabletop.  
Avery(smile): I was kidding! The roses will live to see another day.  
Kylie(smile): You're the worst, {Avery Name}!  
Avery(smile): It's not my fault you fall for it every time.  
\***  
\>  
Narrator: Suddenly, you hear a loud knock on the door.  
Avery: Guess Lucas needs his dressing room back. We'd better go.  
Narrator: You start to turn toward the door, but Kylie holds you back.  
Kylie(happy): I had a really good time tonight, {Avery Name}...  
Message: Romantic Time | You had an intimate moment with Kylie backstage!  
Avery(shy): Me too. Everything's more fun when I'm with you.
