Avery(angry): It's time for us to talk it out, face to face...  
Avery(angry): Tell me why you hate me so much.  
Sam(surprise): You're doing this <i>now</i>?  
\>  
Narrator: Sam wrenches his arm free of your grasp, turning to follow Lucas through the museum doors.  
Avery(surprise)*Shout: Wait!  
# (sfm_04_01_sam_leave)  
## A. Please, just talk to me?  
## B. Don't you dare walk out on me!  
#### A  
Avery(sad): I don't understand what I've been doing wrong...  
Narrator: Sam hesitates, his hand on the door.  
Sam: It's nothing personal...  
#### B  
Avery(angry): After that stunt you pulled with Lucas's manager...  
Avery(angry): ... the least you owe me is an explanation.  
Narrator: Sam turns back to you, his eyes sparking with anger.  
Sam(angry): I don't owe you anything...  
\***  
Sam: And I have to go. Lucas—  
Avery: Lucas will be fine. He has an entire team of security guards out there with him.  
\>>  
Sam(angry): You don't give up, do you?  
Avery(angry): Nope.  
Sam(angry): Fine. You wanna know what my problem is?  
Avery(angry): I really do.  
Sam(angry): It's Lucas. I'm not just his bodyguard.  
Avery(surprise): Wait, you mean you two are...?  
Sam(surprise): What? No, it's not like that!  
Sam: We're friends. Good friends. I've known him for... well, pretty much my whole life.  
Avery: So, you grew up together?  
Sam: Yeah. I didn't make friends easily, when I was a kid...  
Avery: Shocker.  
\*Play Music m_gently_melancholy_bring_me_your_sorrows_01  
Narrator: Sam ignores you, his brow furrowed as he carefully chooses his next words.  
Sam: But Lucas was always... different. He drew me out of my shell.  
Sam(sad): 'Course, the other kids didn't get him. If you stand out at that age, you're a target.  
Avery(sad): Lucas was bullied?  
Sam(sad): He was too trusting, too softhearted...  
Sam(angry): So I knew I had to get strong. Make sure no one could touch him again.  
\>  
Narrator: Your gaze involuntarily falls to the prominent muscles on his chest and arms.  
Avery: Sam...  
# (sfm_04_02_sam_and_lucas)  
## A. You're a good friend.  
## B. I thought you were a bully.  
#### A  
Sam(surprise): I just didn't want him to get hurt. I'm not—  
Avery(happy): It's a compliment. Just say 'thanks.'  
\*Sam REL +1  
Sam(shy): ...Thanks.  
#### B  
Sam(angry): Clearly, you don't know me.  
Avery(angry): No, but your actions so far have spoken for themselves.  
Sam(angry): Don't make assumptions. Everything I do is for Lucas.  
\***  
Avery: Anyway, I still don't see what this has to do with me. Unless...  
Avery(surprise): You really think I'm like those kids who used to pick on Lucas?  
Sam: Not all abuse is physical.  
Sam(angry): A lot of people try to use Lucas for his money and fame. Get close to him, and then...  
Narrator: Sam clenches his jaw.  
\>>  
Sam(angry): I've seen him get hurt too many times.  
Avery(sad): I'm not trying to use Lucas for anything. I wouldn't do that.  
\>>>  
Sam: You say that now, but why should I trust you?  
Sam(angry): You show up out of the blue, and suddenly Lucas can't stop talking about you...  
Avery(surprise): He's the one who's been texting me! I didn't start any of this.  
Sam(angry): Makes no difference to me. You're already getting close to him, and it's gonna end badly.  
Sam(sad): Lucas jumps into things too fast. Always has.  
\>>  
Avery: Sam, listen...  
# (sfm_04_03_sam_care_lucas)  
## A. Lucas can do what he wants.  
## B. You're the one I want to get close to.  
#### A  
Avery(angry): Between you and Barry, I'd say he has enough people making decisions for him.  
Avery(angry): He's an adult, you know?  
Sam: It's not that simple. Sometimes he's fine, but other times...  
Sam(sad): Well. You saw what he was like today.  
Narrator: You frown, remembering how shaken Lucas seemed when he thought you were calling things off.  
Avery: He feels things strongly. So what?  
#### B  
Sam(surprise): {*Attention You... what?}  
Avery: Don't act so surprised. Lucas is sweet, but...  
Avery(shy): I'm into the dark and broody type.  
Narrator: Sam's mouth falls open, and you can't help laughing at his expression.  
Sam(shy): I'm not broody, I just... Stop trying to change the subject!  
\***  
Avery: I'm glad that you explained things to me. You want to keep Lucas safe, and I get that.  
Avery: But all I can do is promise you I'm NOT after his money, or his publicity, or a story...  
Avery: I just <i>like</i> him. He's a good person, and I'd like to get to know him.  
Avery: All I'm asking is that you give me a chance. Let me prove myself.  
Sam: Well, you <i>seem</i> sincere...  
\>  
Narrator: Sam hesitates, rubbing his knuckles while he looks at you.  
Sam: Get coffee with me.  
Avery(surprise): Huh?  
Sam: It's a one-time offer. Yes or no.  
Avery(surprise): I'm waiting for the catch...  
Sam: If I'm going to give you a chance, I need to know more about you.  
Sam(shy): People usually drink coffee when they're getting to know each other. Right?  
Avery(confuse)*Think: Sam actually wants to spend time with me?  
Avery(smile)*Think: This is my chance to earn his trust and get closer to him!  
Avery(shy)*Think: Maybe there's potential for a friendship here... or even something more.  
Sam(smile): How do you say?

Narrator: Sam visibly relaxes, a mixture of relief and disappointment on his face.

Avery(smile): I'll go order while you grab a table. What do you want?  
Narrator: Sam rubs the back of his neck, frowning at the menu full of lattes and macchiatos.  
Sam(confuse): Uh... just nothing too sweet.  
Avery(happy): {*Joyful Got it.} You want something that matches your personality.  
Sam(angry): Hey...  
Avery(smile): You <i>really</i> need to learn how to take a joke, Sam.  
Narrator: Ignoring his huff of annoyance, you step up to the counter while Sam claims a table near the back.  
Narrator: You order some pastries and a drink for yourself.

Narrator: Sam takes a sip of the sugary frappe, and shudders.  
Sam(angry): {*Attention Ugh!} I think my teeth are rotting!  
Narrator: You burst into laughter as he pushes the drink away, wiping his mouth.  
Avery(happy): Sorry, couldn't help myself.

Narrator: A few minutes of silence go by. You sip your coffee while Sam drums on the table with his knuckles...  
Avery: So, what do you...?  
Sam: I guess we should...  
Avery(surprise): Sorry! You go first.  
Narrator: Sam sighs and rubs a hand over his eyes.

Sam: It's the job. Comes with the territory.  
\***  
Avery: I know we seem like polar opposites, but there's <i>got</i> to be some common ground here...  
Sam(confuse): You think?  
Avery: Hear me out. We ask each other icebreaker questions, and see what we agree on.  
Sam(confuse): What if we don't agree on anything?  
Avery(happy): Then we shake hands and swear to never speak again.  
Sam(happy): Funny.  
Sam(surprise): ...Or are you serious?  
Narrator: You wink at Sam and take a long sip of your coffee.

Avery: Wait, let me guess...  
Avery: You like that you have to work for their affection. Unlike dogs, it isn't free.  
Sam(surprise): That's... surprisingly accurate.

### ## B. A dog person.  
### ## C. Both!

Sam(happy): So there is something we agree on.  
#### B  
Avery(happy): Sorry, but I have to go with dogs...  
Avery(happy): Who else will love you so unconditionally?  
Sam(happy): If we can't even agree on this, we're doomed.

Avery(happy): I can see it now... You're outside with your sleeves rolled up, chopping firewood...  
Sam(happy): A man can dream, right?  
Sam: So what about you? Would you rather live in the city?  
Avery: Actually...  
# (sfm_04_04_DP5_city_or_country)

Avery: Hmm, love or career? I have to go with...

Sam: Didn't think we'd agree on something this fundamental.  
Sam(happy): Seems too easy.  
Avery(happy): I know, but I'll take it.

Sam: Just like I thought. We'll never agree.  
Avery(happy): Hey, we're just getting started. Don't give up already.

Sam: You'd be surprised how much the answer can say about a person.  
Avery: Fine then. I would...  
# (sfm_04_04_DP7_trapped_in_a_room)  
## A. Scream until someone helps me.  
## B. Kick the door down.

#### B  
Sam(surprise): Well, that's proactive.  
Avery: I'm not interested in sitting around and waiting to be rescued.  
Avery: I'd rather take action.  
Sam(happy): I respect that.

Avery(happy): You're kinda ruining my image of the big, tough bodyguard.  
Narrator: Sam ignores your teasing, his expression serious.  
Sam: And what if there are armed guards on the other side of the door?  
Sam: It's better to learn as much about your environment as you can before you make a move.  
Sam(angry): Otherwise, you're asking for a bullet to the head.  
Avery(sad): Has anyone ever told you to lighten up?  
Sam(surprise): I thought I was, you know... making conversation.  
Avery(happy): Yeah, bullets to the head are <i>just</i> what I want to hear about over coffee.  
Sam(smile): I could go into more detail if you want.

Avery(surprise): {*Attention Watch it!}

Avery(surprise): Sam, I was just joking around.

Sam: I should go.
