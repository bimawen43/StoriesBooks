Narrator: You hoist your backpack over your shoulder, struggling under the weight of your luggage as you walk through the airport gate.  
Avery(sad): Phew, I'm never doing a red-eye flight again!  
Avery: Better get out of here fast if I want to catch a taxi...  
Narrator: You hurry through the crowded airport, trying to find an exit...  
Narrator: When suddenly your suitcase lurches as one of the wheels breaks off beneath its weight!  
Avery(surprise): Oh no!  
Narrator: You grab for the suitcase, but lose your balance as it spins out of your reach!  
\>>  
Avery(surprise): Excuse me! Sorry! Coming through!  
\>  
Narrator: People jump out of your way as you chase your suitcase through the lobby, ignoring their angry shouts.  
\*Camera Right 2  
Narrator: Picking up speed, the suitcase bangs through a pair of double doors and into an empty hallway.  
Avery(angry): Almost... got it...  
Narrator: Just as you reach for the handle, the suitcase crashes into the wall and pops open, spilling your clothes out all over the floor!  
\>>  
Avery(sad): Seriously? Could this day get any worse?  
\>  
Narrator: The busted wheel finally breaks off of your suitcase and rolls down the hall.  
Avery(sad): I guess that's a yes.

Narrator: Your gaze trails up from the shoe to a pair of stylish skinny jeans, and then further up to see...

Lucas(smile): Looking for this?  
\*Model  
# (sfm_01_05_meet_lucas)  
## A. Sorry! This is so embarrassing...

#### A  
Narrator: The stranger smiles at you, running a hand through his hair.  
Lucas(smile): Don't worry, I've seen worse. At least you didn't faint at my feet.  
Avery(shy): Thank god. I'm so sleep-deprived right now that it honestly wouldn't be out of the question...  
Narrator: You quickly start stuffing your clothes back into your suitcase, trying to hide how flustered you are.  
#### B  
Narrator: The stranger's smile turns into a mischievous smirk.  
Lucas(smile): Well, I guess you found me. By the way, your toothbrush just rolled under the water fountain...  
Avery(surprise): What?  
Narrator: He throws his head back in an easy laugh as you scramble to rescue your toothbrush, stuffing it back into your suitcase.  
\***  
Lucas: Here, let me give you a hand with this. Seems like you've had a long day.  
Avery(sad): Tell me about it. The toddler in the row behind me was kicking my seat for hours...  
Avery(sad): I definitely need a stiff drink, a back rub, and at least twelve hours of sleep.  
Avery(sad): Preferably in that order.  
Narrator: The stranger bursts into laughter as you try to pat down your disheveled hair.  
\>>>  
Avery(surprise): What? Are you laughing at my pain?  
Lucas(smile): Sorry, it's just... you're refreshingly honest.  
\>  
Narrator: He kneels beside you, helping you gather your clothes.  
Avery(smile): Thanks for your help. My name's {Avery Name}, by the way.  
Lucas(happy): Don't mention it, {Avery Name}. Just glad I could catch your runaway suitcase for you.  
Narrator: He flashes you a bright smile, but doesn't introduce himself. You raise your eyebrows.  
Avery: So, what's your name?  
Narrator: His smile falters, and he stops what he's doing to look you full in the face.  
Lucas(surprise): You mean, you don't... know me?  
Avery(surprise): Huh? No, pretty sure I'd remember you if we met somewhere before.  
Narrator: He stares at you for another moment, and then his smile lights up his face again as if it never left.

Lucas(smile): Lucas Parker. Nice to meet you.  
Narrator: He grips your hand in a warm, confident handshake.

Lucas(happy): This is my airport fashion. You like it?  
Avery(confuse): Airport fashion? Doesn't that usually mean sweatpants?  
Lucas: Not if you're me...  
Lucas(smile): And you didn't answer my question.  
\>  
Avery: Do I like your airport fashion?  
# (sfm_01_06_lucas_airport_fashion)

## B. I'd say you're rocking it.

Narrator: He clutches his hand to his heart, an over-the-top expression of anguish on his face.  
Lucas(sad): You wound me. My ego's never been so bruised.

Avery(smile): I'm starting to regret bumping into you...  
\***  
Lucas(happy): Made you smile, though, didn't I?  
Narrator: His hand brushes against yours as he tucks one of your sweaters back into the suitcase. Your eyes meet for a moment...  
Narrator: And then a shout rings out down the hall!  
\*Play Music m_melancholy_modern_doubt_tension_2_hearts_01

Narrator: The tattooed man blinks at you, and his scowl falters for a moment before he quickly recovers it.  
Sam(angry): Don't think you can charm your way out of this. You're not supposed to be in here.  
#### B  
Narrator: The tattooed man scoffs as he narrows his eyes at you.  
Sam(angry): Yeah, right. Don't you know you're not supposed to be in here?  
\***  
Narrator: He jabs his thumb toward a sign on the door. It reads ‘private lounge, authorized personnel only.'  
Avery(surprise): I didn't see the sign! I just came in here cause my suitcase rolled away.  
Lucas: It's true. It rolled right through the doors.  
Avery(sad): Can you let go of my arm now? I'm starting to lose circulation.  
\>>>  
Sam(angry): ...  
\>  
Narrator: His intense gaze bores into you, almost hypnotizing, and he makes no move to let go.  
Narrator: Lucas puts a hand on his shoulder.  
Lucas(confuse): Hey. Everything's fine here, okay?  
Narrator: The tattooed man lets you go so suddenly that you almost stumble. He rounds on Lucas instead, towering over him.  
Sam(angry): Don't even get me started on <i>you.</i> What did I tell you about wandering off like this?  
Sam(sad): Don't you remember what happened in Paris?  
Lucas(happy): I was bored. You know how I get when I can't stretch my legs.  
Narrator: With a long-suffering sigh, the tattooed man rubs a hand over his face.  
Sam: Right. You, pick up your suitcase and get out of here.  
Narrator: He lifts your suitcase as if it weighs nothing and thrusts it into your arms.  
Avery*Think: I should say...  
# (sfm_01_08_pick_up_suitcase)  
## A. Wow, rude.  
## B. Calm down, I'm going!  
#### A  
Avery(angry): Do you realize that you have zero people skills?  
Lucas: Don't take it personally. He's like this with everyone.  
#### B  
Avery(sad): I'm not in trouble, am I?  
Lucas: Don't worry, you haven't done anything wrong. He's just like this.  
\***  
Lucas(happy): You should see him when he's really in a bad mood. His whole face turns red, and--  
\>>>  
Sam(angry): And <i>you</i>, come with me. We need to have a talk.  
\>  
Narrator: Before he can protest, Lucas is being propelled down the hallway at a brisk pace.  
Lucas(happy): Watch out for those wheels, {Avery Name}!  
Narrator: Lucas winks at you over his shoulder.  
Lucas(happy): It's been a pleasure!  
Sam(angry): Would you please stop flirting for five seconds?  
Lucas(happy): Sorry, not possible.  
Narrator: You hear Lucas laugh as they round the corner and move out of sight.  
Avery(surprise): Well, that was weird...  
Narrator: You sigh, gathering your luggage together.  
Avery(sad): Guess I'd better get out of here. Kylie's probably worried sick about me...  
Narrator: You cast one last glance down the hall, then push the doors open with your shoulder and step back out into the airport lobby.

Narrator: Kylie tops off your glasses, looking at you with a mischievous smile.

Kylie(happy): You know, if we really want this housewarming party to be like old times...  
Avery(happy): Oh no, don't say it...

Kylie(happy): We have to play Truth or Dare!  
Avery(confuse): Aren't we too old for that now?  
Kylie(happy): Never! It's tradition!  
\>>  
Avery: Fine, but we're setting some ground rules. No dares that will get us arrested...  
Kylie(surprise): Hey, that was one time!  
Avery: And we both have to really tell the truth this time.  
Kylie(surprise): Would I ever lie?  
\>  
Narrator: You say nothing, raising your eyebrows at her.  
\>>  
Kylie: Okay, so maybe I exaggerate for dramatic effect sometimes...  
Kylie(happy):  I promise to tell the truth this time, okay? Here, pinkie promise.  
\>  
Narrator: You lock your pinkie finger with Kylie's, giving her your best intimidating stare.  
Kylie(happy): I really mean it! Look, I'll even let you go first.

Narrator: Kylie sets down her glass, locks her gaze with yours, and starts to crawl toward you over the pillows.  
Kylie(happy): Not even close. Get ready to have your mind blown.  
Narrator: She hesitates when there's just a breath of air between you, never breaking eye contact...  
Narrator: And then she presses her lips to yours in a slow, lingering kiss.

Kylie(happy): I need my dance partner!

Avery(surprise): Hey!  
Kylie(happy): Let's see those dance moves you were famous for in college!

Kylie: When we were in college, did you ever wish we could be something more than friends?

Avery(happy): Don't tease me, I'm already embarrassed!  
Kylie(happy): Don't be!  I used to think about it, too...  
Kylie: But I never wanted to risk our friendship, you know?  
Avery: Yeah, same here. I guess we just never really found the right timing.
