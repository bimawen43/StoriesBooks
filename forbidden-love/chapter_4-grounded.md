Natalie(surprise): {*Attention Oh my god!}  
Narrator: You step backward, further from the flames... and the exit.  
Dean_Bishop(angry): What the hell is going on here?  
Teri*Shout(angry): Everybody out! Come on!

Natalie(angry): Dad can win or lose the election. I have to live my life. I didn't agree to any of this!  
Dad(angry): You didn't agree to any of this, but you certainly benefited from it, didn't you?  
Dad: I didn't hear you complaining when this salary got you everything you ever wanted.  
Amy(smile): Come on, Ms. {Natalie LastName}. You haven't ever used the family name to get your-self out of a jam?  
#### B  
Natalie(angry): I'll call a press conference first thing tomorrow morning and set the record straight.  
Natalie(angry): The <i>new</i> front-page story will be the bloodthirsty media!  
Amy: That's a little naive, Ms. {Natalie LastName}.  
Amy(smile): An arsonist sparking up a forbidden romance with the daughter of his mother's political opponent?  
Amy(smile): It's got drama.  
Amy(sad): The truth? That the fire was an accident and the two kids are just friends who have each other's backs?  
Amy(sad): Boring. No front-page. No way.

Dad(angry): You stop seeing Devon, effective immediately, until after the election at least.

Natalie(angry): He literally <i>saved me from a fire</i> last night.  
Natalie(angry): When all my friends were outside, he stayed behind and looked for me!  
Natalie: What kind of person ditches a man like that?  
Dad: What kind of man, exactly? A criminal, or a mere troublemaker?  
Dad(angry): This wasn't the first fire Devon ended up magically involved in...  
\>>  
Dad(angry): And we have it on good authority that his mother had to pull a lot of strings to get him into Stonebriar.  
Natalie(angry): I don't care what your files say. I know him personally, and he's a good guy.  
Natalie(angry): I'm not going to stop seeing him.
