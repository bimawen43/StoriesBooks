Narrator: Mom smiles, but a tear escapes her eye as she pulls you into a tight hug.  
Narrator: You fight back the tears, too, every part of your senses trying to memorize your mom.  
Narrator: The scent of her perfume, her small frame holding you, and how the soft fabric of her shirt feels on your skin.  
\>>  
Rosie: So, please, don't shut me out, okay? I want to help you in any way I can.  
Mom(smile): I promise, honey. I love you so much.

Mom(happy): Ah-hah, sure it is.  
#### B  
Rosie(smile): ... A tough nut to crack, to be honest. The toughest one yet.  
Rosie(smile): But it's not a surprise though, he's got a lot on the line.  
\***  
Mom(smile): Tell me about him.  
Rosie(smile): Well, he's the COO of Silverstein Corp., and he has agreed to marry Ashley Silverstein...  
Rosie: ... The CEO's daughter, in order to become the next CEO.  
Mom(surprise): Oh! So he doesn't love her?  
Rosie(smile): No. He promised he'd be faithful to her and stop his serial-flirting...  
Rosie(smile): ... But Mr. Silverstein doesn't trust his word.  
Mom(confuse): So, you're testing him?  
Rosie(smile): Yeah. I have until New Year's Eve to seduce him.  
Mom(surprise): Wow, that's a long time you have to...  
Mom(sad): ...  
Rosie(confuse): Lie... I know you don't like it, and I know you don't like my job, but it pays really well.  
Rosie(smile): So, I'll be able to help pay off some of your medical bills.  
Mom(sad): You don't have to spend your hard-earned money on my bills, sweetie.  
Rosie(sad): I know you don't like that either...  
Rosie(sad): ... But you know otherwise they might take the house if you should pass away.  
Rosie: Besides, I like to think that if I can help pay the bills, then you won't stress as much.  
Rosie(happy): And that will help you beat this thing and recover more quickly.  
Mom(smile): I can't believe we raised such a kind and generous woman. Thank you, {Rosie Name}.  
Rosie(sad): But I'll only get paid the full amount if I manage to seduce him. If not, I'll won't even get half.  
Mom(smile): I see. I'm sure you can do it.

Narrator: Mom points to a small gold coin in the upper right corner.  
Mom(happy): He always carried it with him. He found it out by the barn once; it's really rare.  
Rosie(smile): Matt carries a coin around too. I wonder if he's got one of these in his collection.  
Mom: I doubt it. I remember Paul told me there's only ever been found around a dozen of this one.  
Rosie(surprise): Whoa. The collection must be worth a lot of money.  
Mom(smile): It probably is...

Mom(sad): But that way, I wouldn't have to rely on you so much.  
Rosie(smile): I know, but selling this would be like letting go of a big piece of him.  
Rosie(smile): And besides, seeing the way you look at this, is like seeing the way you looked at him.  
Message: Impact! | Mom won't sell the coin collection.  
Mom: Alright. I won't sell it, but there's one thing I'd like you to do for me.

Mom(smile): And if you don't want it, then maybe you can give it to Matt?  
Mom(shy): He sounds like a man who would appreciate it, and who knows, maybe he'll love you for it?  
Rosie(sad): Mom... I'm not interested in Matt loving me...  
Mom(confuse): Maybe not right now, but I think he might be more than an assignment for you, {Rosie Name}.  
Rosie(smile): Matt would probably like this a lot...
