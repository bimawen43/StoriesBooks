Rosie(smile)*Think: Sure, I could get him to kiss me, but can I get him to sleep with me?

Matt(smile): You should.

Matt(smile): Slept well?  
Rosie(smile): Too well. I didn't feel like leaving your bed ever again.  
Rosie(sad): Especially not when I have to go home and face everything that happened yesterday.  
Matt(smile): It'll be fine. Maybe the police have some leads already.  
Rosie(sad): I hope so.

Matt(smile): Anyway, are you ready to leave?

Narrator: At least your office kind of has the same feel as Matt's apartment, but you'll soon discover it's far from as safe.  
Narrator: You put your bag on the desk, taking a big gulp of your coffee when Brisa walks in.  
Brisa(happy): So, tell me how the Winter Formal wa—  
Brisa(surprise): That was a big gulp. Is it that kind of morning? Did you have a nightmare again?  
Rosie(sad): ...  
# (htcac_10_19_nightmare_again)  
## A. Worse.  
## B. I wish.  
#### A  
Rosie(sad): It's way worse, Brisa. I need to tell you about it.  
#### B  
Rosie(sad): I wish it was only a nightmare, Brisa... I need to tell you everything.  
\***  
Rosie(sad): But first, let me find my charger for my phone. I slept at Matt's place and forgot to bring mine.  
Brisa(smile): Oh, you slept at Matt's place, huh?  
Rosie(sad): Yeah, but it's not what you think... unfortunately.  
\*Play Music m_doubts  
Narrator: You grab the handle of your desk drawer, pulling it open to grab your charger...

Narrator: But as the drawer opens, an ominous rattling sound fills the room before the source of the horrifying sound is revealed.

Brisa(terror)*Shout: Oh, my God! A snake!  
Narrator: Before you even get to think about moving out of harm's way, the snake lurches towards you and sinks its fangs into your flesh.  
Narrator: You stumble backward, falling to the floor, and knocking over a few things on your way down.  
Rosie(sad): Ugh...  
Brisa(terror)*Shout: Help! Help!
