Narrator: Although all the houses look the same in the suburbs of New York with their multi-gabled pitched roofs, double-height entry arches...  
Narrator: ... And Palladian windows with fake shutters...

Rosie(sad): And if that's the case, not saying it is, then it would make sense for her to be with him.  
Matt(sad): Hmm, I guess?  
Rosie(confuse): Secondly, Lou's customers are mainly regulars, but she's never seen these two before.

Silverstein: Well, I'm sorry, but it's not up for negotiation, Ms. Winter.

Narrator: He knocks on the door three times before opening it.  
Narrator: He gestures you to walk inside the luxurious office, and he swiftly follows.  
Narrator: You see a tall, muscular man stand by the windows.  
Narrator: You can only see his silhouette, the sun blinds you, but you can tell that he's talking on his phone.  
Narrator: He's dressed in a dark, slightly shiny, silver suit that's obviously a slim-fit. It hugs his body in all the right places.  
Rosie(smile)*Think: Okay, so far, so good. At the very least, he's probably not going to be a hideous target.  
Narrator: Mr. Silverstein clears his throat impatiently.  
Silverstein: Mr. Dalton, I found you a new personal assistant.

Narrator: The man turns around, ending his call, and that is when you realize you've seen that handsome face before.
