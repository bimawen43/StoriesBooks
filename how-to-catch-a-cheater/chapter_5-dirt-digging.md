Narrator: The following Monday.  
Brisa(smile): So, how did the gala go? I'm still sad I couldn't go.  
Rosie(smile): It was okay.  
Rosie: Mr. Silverstein promised me I'd get more personal experiences with Matt outside of Silverstein Corp.  
Brisa(happy): Your job seems so exciting and mysterious! Any way I can help?  
Rosie(sad): I don't suppose you can magically make him and I grow closer?  
Brisa(smile): Nah, I guess that only happens when you really get to know someone, their likes, and dislikes.  
Rosie(sad): I've tried to look him up because I obviously can't just ask him out, but the information is limited.  
Rosie: I don't understand why. He's kind of a celebrity, right? I mean, to New York City at least.  
Rosie: There should be plenty of things to find on him.  
Brisa(confuse): Actually, I can tell you why that is. Silverstein Corp. has its very own Corporate Image manager.  
Brisa(smile): And she tries her best to keep all the juicy gossip from the tabloids to protect the company.  
Brisa(confuse): I bet she's got a lot of interesting stuff on her computer.  
Rosie(sad): I wish I had access to it.  
Rosie: That way, I could probably get some more insights on who Matthew Dalton really is.  
Brisa: Actually, you don't need to get to her computer to gain access.  
Rosie(surprise): What? How do you know?  
Brisa(smile): Well, as the CEO's secretary, it's my job to make sure everything is in order.  
Brisa: ... And that requires access to all the folders and files in the company's database.  
Narrator: You can't believe what you're hearing. You lean in closer to her and whisper.  
Rosie(surprise): Are you telling me you could look into that folder if you wanted to?  
\>>  
Brisa: Hmm... technically, yes, the only problem is I can't do it on my computer.  
Brisa: I can gain access, but the Corporate Image folder is pretty important, obviously.  
Brisa: So, only the Corporate Image manager, Mr. Silverstein, and Mr. Dalton...  
Brisa: ... Have that folder on their computers.  
Brisa: Now, I don't have access to the 22nd floor where the office of the Corporate Image manager is...  
Brisa(smile): But you probably have a spare key to Mr. Dalton's office, yes?  
Rosie: Yes, but he's in there all the time?  
Rosie: And whenever he's not, it's probably for a meeting, and I usually accompany him to those.  
Brisa(confuse): Which is why we need to do it at night when no one is around.  
Brisa(smile): As Mr. Dalton's assistant, you've got access to the front doors, too, right? Because I don't.  
Rosie: I do, I've got the password.  
Brisa(happy): Perfect!  
Rosie: But Brisa...

Brisa(sad): Well, there are multiple reasons but...  
Brisa: Ashley has been nothing but arrogant, condescending...  
Brisa: ... And rude to me every time I've been in contact with her.  
Brisa(smile): And Mr. Dalton is a good man, ruthless and kinda scary, but he's nothing like her.  
Brisa: Ashley doesn't deserve him.  
Rosie(smile): I agree.  
Brisa(happy): Let's do it then. Meet me outside Silverstein Corp. tonight.

Rosie(sad): Good. There are security cameras, too, right?  
Brisa(smile): Yeah, but I doubt they'll be looking through them unless something is reported stolen.

Mom(sad): I know, honey. It was a terrible year.  
Mom(sad): People talked about his accident for months, which didn't help at all either.  
Narrator: The media called it a freak accident. Your dad's tractor somehow turned over during harvesting, landing on top of him. He died instantly.  
Rosie(sad): It all taught me an important lesson; the importance of saying goodbye, saying I love you.  
Rosie(sad): Nothing hurts more than having to walk around every day and wonder if he knew.  
Mom(sad): Oh, {Rosie Name}. He knew how much you loved him.  
Mom(sad): He'd be heartbroken to hear you've been doubting that.  
Rosie(sad): Are you sure?  
Mom(smile): There's nothing in the world that I'm surer of.  
Rosie(smile): Thanks, Mom.

Narrator: You read the text and see the photos that were attached to it.  
Rosie(terror)*Think: {*Attention What?!}  
Narrator: As you read the message that forever imprinted itself on your retina, every muscle in your body goes limp.  
Narrator: Your legs collapse from under you. Your stomach churns, threatening to banish your breakfast from your body.  
Rosie(cry)*Think: This can't be real. This isn't happening, not today! Not on our wedding day!

Narrator: ... And the occasional picture of a male's genitalia that you, unfortunately, recognize as Ben's.  
Rosie(cry)*Think: These messages are over a year old. Ben's been cheating on me for over a freaking year?!
