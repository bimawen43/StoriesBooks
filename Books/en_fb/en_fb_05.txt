Natalie: Personally, I admire the fact that his mother worked her way up from the bottom to run for governor.
Royce: Yeah, well, you can run into a lot of surly types at 'the bottom.'

Royce(smile): And I bet they're <i>desperate</i> to get to the top.
Natalie: They're <i>just</i> middle-class. That's all. And Mary-Anne has a long, clean record of leadership.
Royce(angry): I'm not talking about Mary-Anne Hart, I'm talking about Devon. It's not about money.
Natalie: Then what's it about?
B
Royce: I wouldn't call him 'honest, I'd call him 'out of control.'
Natalie(happy): As someone who loves control, I can see how that would bother you.

Royce(angry): He doesn't have to bow to me, but he should be bowing to <i>someone</i>, shouldn't he?
Royce: I have to wonder what someone so reckless and lawless is doing in their spare time.
Natalie(smile): You're worried about what Devon does in his spare time?
Natalie: Don't you think you're being a little paranoid?
C
Natalie: I find it refreshing, personally.
Royce: To me, 'rough' seems like 'desperate.' 'Willing to do anything.' 'Selfish.'

A. Real.

Natalie(angry): Just because your hacker couldn't dig through his IP address doesn't mean he's done anything.
