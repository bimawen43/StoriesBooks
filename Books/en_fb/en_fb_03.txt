Narrator: Devon bites his lower lip as you do a slow walk toward him, clutch his lapels, and draw him close.

Devon(shy): I'd be honored, m'lady.
Narrator: Devon takes your hand and holds it overhead, spinning you in a loose circle in front of him.

Devon: Yeah, I guess. I don't give a damn about that kind of thing, but it could seriously impact the election. 
Natalie: Forgive me for not really seeing that you were that kind of guy.
Devon(surprise): The kind of guy who cares about his mom's career?
Devon(shy): My mom and I are really close.
Devon(sad): And I know being seen kissing me wouldn't be the best picture on public record for you, either.
Narrator: You feel a twinge, but force a nod. He's exactly right.

Natalie(angry): I have a boyfriend. I made a conscious choice to be with Royce. I made it a long time ago.
Devon(surprise): I'm sorry. I thought... because you're out here with me at all... that you must've been interested.
Devon: You've gotta forgive me for thinking you and Royce are a front. Your relationship doesn't seem real.
Natalie: It's real enough. We're helping each other achieve a unified future.
Devon(surprise): How... romantic.
Natalie(smile): It's okay if you don't understand.
Devon(sad): I understand. It just makes me sad.

Devon(sad): Oh... Are you still in love with him?
Natalie(sad): It's old-fashioned to wait before publicly hooking up with someone else, isn't it?
Devon(smile): You do kind of seem old-fashioned.
Natalie(shy): I just don't want any trouble for you, or for myself.

Natalie(sad): Royce has anger issues.
Devon(angry): I'm not afraid of him, and I won't let you be afraid of him either.
Natalie(sad): I wish it was that easy, Devon.

Natalie: Let's forget about it, okay?
Devon(sad): I'll try.
Natalie: I'm starting to dry off. Do you want to head back inside before they start to realize we're missing?

Narrator: You notice that someone has lit the inside with candles.
Devon(happy): I wonder if they thought it was creepily romantic, or if they just couldn't figure out the fusebox.
Natalie(happy): Maybe a little bit of both.
Natalie: Either way, I hope Bishop didn't notice that we went missing. I think he has it out for both of us.
Devon(shy): You got that feeling too, huh?
Narrator: You scan the dimly lit room for Kat and Sierra, but someone steps into your path...
Royce(angry): {Natalie Name}...
Natalie(surprise): Royce! I didn't see you there!
Narrator: But Royce isn't listening to you. His eyes are glued to your arm linked with Devon's, and his chest rises up and down like an animal about to lunge.
