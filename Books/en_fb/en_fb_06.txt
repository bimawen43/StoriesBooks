Narrator: You sprinkle some sugar into the pan, then add bacon and garlic, then simmer the green beans in a broth.
Narrator: At first, it looks okay, but then...
Natalie(surprise): I think the sugar burnt in the pan instead of melting in the broth!
Natalie(sad): The bacon looks undercooked, too.
Mary_Anne(sad): Oh no! You need the broth first so all the elements can mix and melt together.
Mary_Anne: Without that liquidy base, some things stick to the pan, and others cook more slowly.
Natalie(sad): I'm sorry. I guess I wasn't listening closely.
Devon: Hey, don't let it bother you. Cooking's so complicated. 
Devon: Let me cut you up some fresh green beans. Try again.
