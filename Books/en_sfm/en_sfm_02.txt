Narrator: You stand in the open doorway to your apartment, blinking in shock at the unexpected visitors in front of you.
Lucas(smile): Did you miss me?
Avery(surprise): The guys from the airport...?

Lucas(happy): In the flesh.
Avery(surprise): But how do you know where I live?
Sam: Don't flatter yourself, we're not stalking you.

Narrator: Lucas rolls his eyes at his surly companion.
Lucas: Ignore him. I usually do.
Lucas: Anyway, sorry for dropping by out of the blue. But we thought you might be missing this...
Narrator: He holds something out to you, and with a jolt you recognize your passport.

Avery(confuse): How did you get that?
Lucas: You dropped it when your luggage spilled. We found it in the hallway after you left.
>
Narrator: You reach out to take the passport, your fingers brushing Lucas's.
Narrator: The burly man behind him visibly tenses for a moment, then relaxes when you pull your hand back.
Lucas: Your address was written on the back cover, so we decided to drop it off in person.
Avery: Lucas, that's...
(sfm_02_01_return_passport)
A. So kind of you. Thank you!
B. A little creepy, to be honest.

*Lucas REL +1
Lucas(happy): Hey, don't mention it.
Avery: No, really, I owe you one. I wouldn't want to lose this.
Avery(happy): And not many people would be so thoughtful. I can't believe you came all the way here.
Lucas(smile): Getting the chance to see you again is all the thanks I need.
Narrator: Lucas winks at you, and you stifle a laugh behind your hand.
B
Avery(sad): I mean, I don't even know you... and you show up at my apartment like this?
Lucas(surprise): Oh. I didn't think of it like that.
Sam: I tried to warn him this would happen.
Sam(sad): As you can see, he didn't listen. Not that he ever does.
Lucas(sad): Sorry, {Avery Name}. I meant well, I promise.
Narrator: Lucas looks so forlorn that you have to stifle a smile.
Avery(smile): It's okay. I'm sure you had good intentions.

Avery: Did you have to show up at the crack of dawn, though?
Avery(shy): I'm a bit of a mess. Wasn't expecting visitors this early...
Narrator: You awkwardly rub a hand over your eyes, still heavy with sleep.
Sam: Less people on the roads at this hour. Better chance of avoiding any incidents.
>>>
Avery(surprise): Incidents?
>>
Lucas: He means it's easier to find parking. Less traffic, and all that. Right?
Narrator: Lucas shoots his companion a look that's somewhere between a glare and a plea.
Sam: ...Right. That's what I meant.
Narrator: You glance across the street behind them to see a large, glossy black car.
Narrator: It's parked between an ancient-looking Volvo and a VW Beetle with duct tape covering a missing window.
Avery(surprise): Your car is, uh... nice.
Narrator: They both follow your gaze and shift a bit, seeming to notice for the first time how out of place they are on your quiet street.
Narrator: Lucas's companion coughs quietly.

Avery: So, do you want to...

Sam(angry): Hard pass. We're not going in there.
>
Avery(angry): I was just trying to be polite.
B
Lucas: Oh, I don't know if we have to leave just yet—
Sam: No, that's exactly what we should be doing.
>>>
Sam: See, Lucas? At least <i>this</i> one has some sense.
Avery(angry): I have a name, you know. Not that you've even told me yours...
Sam(angry): And I don't plan to, since this is the last time we'll be seeing you.

Narrator: Tension fills the air as you glare at each other. Lucas nervously hovers between you.
>>
Lucas(surprise): Okay, so this isn't going how I hoped...
Lucas(happy): But that's okay! I have a better idea!
>>>
Lucas(smile): {Avery Name}, have dinner with me. I'll send a car for you tonight.
Avery(surprise): Send a car?
Sam(surprise): What?
>>
Lucas(smile):  Nothing would make me happier than the chance to get to know you better...
Lucas(confuse): What do you say?
Narrator: Before you can answer, a familiar voice rings through the apartment behind you.

Narrator*Top: Kylie | Hey, who are you talking to?
Narrator: Kylie shuffles over to you, smothering a huge yawn as she peers over your shoulder.
Kylie(sad): You woke me from my beauty sleep...
>>>
Kylie(surprise): Oh.
>
Narrator: She freezes, staring at Lucas with eyes as round as saucers.
Avery: Kylie? Uh, these are the guys I told you about, from the airport...
>>>
Kylie(surprise): ...

Sam(sad): Oh boy, here we go...
Lucas(smile): Are you the roommate? Nice to meet you.

Narrator: Lucas flashes his boyish smile at Kylie, seeming not to notice her stunned expression.
Sam: Lucas, we should really just get out of here before—

Kylie(surprise): But you're... Aren't you...? And you're on my doorstep...?

Narrator: Kylie lets out a squeal before clamping both hands over her mouth, staring from Lucas to you and back again.

Kylie(happy): I'm still sleeping, right? {Avery Name}, pinch me!
Avery(surprise): I promise she's not usually like this...
>
Narrator: You turn back to the others, frowning at Kylie's weird behavior...
Narrator: Only to see that Lucas's friend is quickly propelling him down the steps and away from your door.
Avery(surprise): Wait!
Sam(angry): Car. Now.
>>>
Lucas(happy): I'll send my driver to pick you up at eight tonight, {Avery Name}!
>
Narrator: Lucas throws a cheerful wave over his shoulder as he's manhandled into the passenger seat of the shiny black car.

Avery: Lucas? He's...
(sfm_02_03_who_is_lucas)
A. A cute stranger who's totally into me?
B. Some guy who's way too full of himself?
C. Not my priority. His hot friend, though...

B
Kylie(surprise): Duh, he's full of himself! You would be too if you were him!

Kylie(happy): I actually thought he seemed surprisingly humble. I mean, I know he barely talked to me, but...

Kylie(surprise): Oh my god he talked to me!

Kylie: "Friend"? I'm pretty sure that's his bodyguard...
Kylie(surprise): And weren't you two glaring daggers at each other?
Avery(happy): That's what makes it interesting. And Lucas isn't really my type.
Kylie: You're literally the only person in the world who would say that...

Kylie(happy): Especially when he was standing right there in front of you! Oh my god—

Avery(surprise): Calm down, we're not starting the "oh my god" chant again.

Narrator: Kylie takes a deep breath, visibly composing herself.
Kylie: Okay. I'm calm. I'm good.
Avery: Now can you <i>please</i> fill me in on what's going on here? I'm clearly missing something.
Kylie: I know you've been living like a hermit for the last year, but did you really not recognize him?
Narrator: Kylie looks up at you in disbelief, but you just shrug.
>>
Avery: No internet, remember?
Kylie(surprise): But that was Lucas Lucky!
Avery(surprise): He said his name was Lucas Parker.
Kylie: "Lucky" is a stage name. {Avery Name}, he's the biggest singer in the world right now.
>>>
Avery(surprise): A singer?
Kylie(smile): Not just a singer, a pop star!
>>
Kylie(smile): Ever since he burst into the music scene last year, he's been at the top of the charts.
Kylie(happy): Seriously, you must be the only person in the city who's never heard of him.
Avery(surprise): Whoa...
Kylie(smile): Whoa is right.
Avery(surprise): Do you think he was offended that I didn't recognize him?
Kylie(smile): Oh please, he asked you out to dinner! If anything, I think he liked it.
Avery(sad): I don't know... I can't help worrying I made a fool of myself.
>>>
Kylie(confuse): I saw the way he smiled at you. You have nothing to worry about.

Kylie: Well, unless his bodyguard throws you into a choke hold or something...

Kylie(smile): I never back down from a challenge.

Avery: Is his music even any good?

Avery(confuse): You mean you'll help me research him?
Kylie: Oh yeah, we can go deep. Wouldn't you rather be armed with knowledge instead of going in blind?

Lucas: The courses are fixed for tonight, but I'm sure the chef would oblige if I requested an alternative menu.
Avery(surprise): Uh, that's okay. French cuisine sounds perfect.
Narrator: Lucas picks up on your discomfort, giving you a soft smile.
Lucas(happy): Is the rooftop too much? I'm coming on too strong, huh?
Avery(shy): It's not that. I just feel like I should be honest with you...
Narrator: Lucas tenses, his smile faltering for a moment.
Lucas: Oh?
Avery: I know who you are now. My roommate recognized you.
Lucas(happy): Is that all? You had me worried for a minute there.
Avery: I just wanted to be upfront about it. I really didn't know who you were when we met, but...
Lucas(happy): It's alright. It was fun while it lasted.
Avery(surprise): <b>"Fun"?</b>

Lucas(smile): Would you like some wine? They told me it's their oldest vintage.
Narrator: Lucas pours from a very expensive-looking bottle of wine, and you raise your eyebrows.
Avery(happy): Yeah, I can't imagine why people wouldn't treat you normally...
Avery(surprise): Sorry! I didn't mean that, it's just... the wine... and the rooftop...
Narrator: Lucas laughs, and the sound is so bright that you can't help smiling along with him.
>>>R
Lucas(happy): Please don't apologize. This is what I like about you.

Lucas(smile): Promise me you'll always speak your mind like that, okay?
Avery(happy): Okay. I promise.
Lucas(happy): Thanks. It's a relief to meet someone who doesn't have preconceived assumptions about me.
Lucas: There's a reason my social life has been... well, pretty nonexistent.
Narrator: There's a lull in the conversation as you both try your food. Lucas gazes out over the city as you eat.
Avery(surprise): Oh my god. I think my mouth is in heaven.
Lucas(surprise): Huh?
Lucas(happy): Oh, the meal. Good, right?
Avery(happy): This is hands down the best food I've ever eaten.
Lucas(happy): See, these are just the kinds of reminders I need. It gets so easy to just...
Narrator: His smile fades away as he looks down at his plate.
Lucas: For a while now, it's felt like I'm drifting through life on autopilot. Taking things for granted.
Lucas(sad): I need to remember what normal feels like, sometimes.
Avery: Well, if you're looking for normal...

Lucas: Somehow, I doubt that.

Lucas: Honestly, it doesn't feel like I had much of a choice. I love singing. It's my passion.
Lucas: But you're right, there's nothing worse than listening to a celebrity complain about his life...

Narrator: You tell him about college, and how you spent the last year teaching English abroad.
Narrator: He listens so attentively that you forget to feel self-conscious.
Avery: ...And now I'm here. Trying to figure out what I want to do with my life.
Lucas: So you want to help people? Teaching those kids, that was fulfilling for you?
Avery: Yeah, it was. It felt like I could really make a difference in their lives...
Avery: But now there are so many paths I could take, it's hard to know where to start.
Lucas(happy): You'll find the right path. I can tell.
Avery: I guess you'd know what that's like...
Avery(happy): If your popularity's anything to go by, I'd say you definitely found the right path.

Avery(shy): Honestly? Yeah.
Avery(shy): But it seems like you're the king of leading people on without ever making a commitment.
