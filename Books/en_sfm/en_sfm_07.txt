Avery(surprise): AAAH!
Narrator: You stare in horror at the dead mouse you just pulled from your pocket.
Narrator: The sound of its body hitting the pavement echoes through your head.
Sam(surprise): {Avery Name}!
Narrator: Sam sprints toward you.
Sam(surprise): I heard you shout. What happened?
Avery(sad): I'm fine. Someone pushed me, and...
Narrator: You gesture to the dead mouse.
Sam(angry): You don't mean...
Avery(sad): Yeah. They slipped that into my pocket.
Sam(angry): {Avery Name}, if they hurt you...
Narrator: Sam looks back and forth down the alleyway, fists clenched.
Avery: It's no use. They ran off.
Sam(sad): Are you sure you're okay?
Avery: I'm just...
A. Shaken and angry.
B. Glad you're here.
A
Avery(sad): If they'd had a weapon, I could be dead right now.
Avery(angry): I should've heard them coming, or at least been able to fight them off.
Sam: You were caught by surprise. It's not your fault.
B
Narrator: Sam puts a reassuring hand on your arm.
*Sam REL +1
Sam: You're safe now. I promise.

Sam: Come on, let's get out of here. I'll take you and Kylie home.
Avery: Lucas should come too. We need to talk.

Narrator: When you're all gathered in your living room, you take a deep breath.
Avery(sad): I've been getting texts from an unknown number for the last few weeks.
Avery(sad): <i>'Stay away from him or you'll be sorry'<i/>... that kind of thing.
*Condition
A. (Condition: SHOWED_KYLIE_TEXT_5 >= 1)
B. (Condition: KEPT_TEXT_SECRET_5 >= 1)
A
Kylie(sad): I told {Avery Name} not to do anything hasty.
Kylie(sad): The police can't take action unless it's a direct threat.
B
Kylie(surprise): <i>What?</i> And you didn't tell me?
Avery(sad): I didn't want you to worry.
Kylie(angry): I work for the <i>police.</i> If anyone could help you with this, it's me.
***
Sam: You think things could get violent?
Avery(sad): The dead mouse was clear enough.
Avery(angry): They want me to know what will happen to me if I keep ignoring them.
Kylie: It's obvious what this is about, right?
Kylie(sad): None of this started until {Avery Name} met Lucas.
Narrator: You all turn to stare at Lucas. He looks down at his hands.
Lucas(sad): ...
Avery(sad): Lucas...?
Lucas: I've been getting messages too.
Sam(angry): <i>What?</i>
Lucas: I didn't think anything of it. I get hate mail all the time...
Sam(angry): Lucas, how many times have I told you to report death threats to me?
Lucas(sad): Not now, Sam. I'm too tired.
Avery: No one outside of this room has any idea that I even know Lucas...
Avery: Except for Barry and the security staff, of course.
Kylie: Well, Hoodie Stalker clearly recognized you today. They know who you are.
Lucas(sad): Maybe Barry was right all along. Maybe you should stay away from me.
Avery(surprise): Just roll over and do what the blackmailer wants?
Kylie(sad): I've read about cases like this one. If the stalker's initiated physical contact...
Sam(angry): Then it's personal now. They won't stop.
*Condition
A. (Condition: GOT_HOODIE >= 1)
A.
Narrator: You lift up the stalker's hoodie, showing everyone the logo.
Avery: At least I got this. The woman could be an employee at this Phil's Seafood place.

Kylie: That was smart thinking, {Avery Name}. Any information is vital right now.
*Sam REL +1
Sam: Not many people would be brave enough to chase their assailant down like that.
*Lucas REL +1
Lucas: I'm just glad you didn't get hurt. That's all that matters.
***
Sam: If you want my advice, you shouldn't be unarmed.
Narrator: Sam pulls a foldable knife out of his pocket and hands it to you.
Sam: It's not much, but it could make all the difference when it comes to self-defense.
Narrator: You flip the knife open, admiring the sharp blade.
Avery(happy): I'd definitely feel safer if I had this on me...

Sam: I'll keep my security team on full alert tonight, just to be safe.
Sam: We're not really equipped to guard <i>two</i> people, but—
Lucas: {Avery Name} can stay at my place tonight.
Avery(surprise): Your place?
Sam(surprise): Lucas, do you really want to risk that right now?
Lucas: You said yourself that this apartment is literally a break-in waiting to happen.
Lucas(sad): No offense, Kylie.
Kylie(sad): None taken. You get what you pay for.
Avery: Ky, will you be okay here alone? The stalker's still out there.
Kylie: Please, Hoodie Stalker's made it clear who they care about and it's not me.
Sam: It <i>will</i> be easier to guard you both if you're in the same place...
Lucas: Then we're all agreed. {Avery Name} stays with me tonight.

Narrator: Later that night, you step into the penthouse suite of the nicest hotel in the city.
Avery(surprise): You <i>live</i> here?
Lucas: For now.
Narrator: Lucas steps into the room and tosses his jacket onto a sleek leather chair.
Sam: I'll have someone posted right outside the door.
Sam: If you hear anything suspicious, or get any messages—
Lucas: I know the drill, Sam. We're good.
Narrator: With a nod to you, Sam leaves you and Lucas alone in the suite.
Lucas(sad): I know it's not homey like your place. Sorry about that.
Avery: Lucas, this place is...
A. Amazing. I'd kill to live here!
B. So impersonal. Like a hotel.
A
Avery(happy): I mean, look at this view! It's incredible.
Narrator: Lucas gives you a small smile.
Lucas(happy): I'm glad you like it.
B
Avery(sad): There's nothing of <i>you</i> in here.
Lucas(sad): It's just a temporary living situation for me.
***
Lucas: I move around so much, it's not really worth it to settle down anywhere.
Avery: So you're always on the road?
Lucas: Pretty much. When I'm not touring, I'm in the studio.
Avery(sad): That must be hard.
Lucas: I'm used to it.
Narrator: Lucas rubs a hand over his eyes, flopping down onto a loveseat.
Lucas: Anyway, there's plenty of room for two. Make yourself at home.
Narrator: You slowly wander around the suite, complete with a guest bedroom and a Jacuzzi.
Avery(happy): I don't think I'd <i>ever</i> get used to this...
Lucas(happy): To be honest, I'm glad to have the company.
Lucas(smile): What's the point of all this if you can't share it?
Avery(happy): I'm glad you invited me.
Lucas (happy): Take a look around. Don’t leave out any details when you write your article.
Avery (surprise): Lucas, are you saying…?
Lucas (happy): I thought it over. I want you to write about me, {Avery Name}.
Avery: You’re sure? Bethany said it has to be personal…
Lucas: I’m sure. I wouldn’t trust this to anyone but you.
Lucas(happy): Besides, my songwriting’s been better than ever since I met you…
Lucas(happy): If you can be my muse, why can’t I be yours?
Avery(happy): Lucas, you have no idea what this means to me! Thank you!
Lucas(happy): From now on… I’m an open book. Be gentle with me. 
Narrator: Lucas smiles at you, his eyes warm and trusting.
Avery(happy): (I should…)

Avery (happy): You won’t regret this. I promise.
Narrator: He kisses you back, tender and sweet.
Lucas (smile): I’m not sure this is professional. Is it part of your research?
Avery (smile): Nope. This is just for me.

Avery (happy): I’m going to put my heart and soul into this article…

Avery (happy): That’s ‘cause I know the real you now. And I want everyone else to know him too.
Narrator: Lucas nods, his shoulders relaxing like a weight’s been lifted.
Lucas (happy): I can’t wait to see what you write.
***
Lucas (happy): Now that we’ve got that figured out…
Avery (happy): Why do you look like you’ve got a surprise in store?
Lucas (happy): You haven’t seen all the perks of mi casa yet.
Avery (happy): Oh? Do tell.
Lucas (happy): I’ve got a hot tub that will blow your mind.
Lucas(happy): I know you're probably ready to crash, but if you want to unwind a bit...
Narrator: Lucas jerks his head toward the Jacuzzi, a questioning look in his eyes.
Avery(happy): (Should I take advantage of this penthouse and stay up late with Lucas?)
Avery(smile): (This could be my chance to take our relationship to the next level!)
Avery(happy): Right now, I want...
A. You, me, and a hot tub. (Cost: 25 Diamond)
B. Some sleep. I'm exhausted.

Lucas(happy): You sure know how to make it look inviting.
Narrator: Lucas sets a tray of fruits and chocolates next to the hot tub and steps into the water.
Lucas(happy): Help yourself to a bite to eat. And there's champagne.
Avery(happy): I expect nothing less from <i>the</i> Lucas Lucky.
Avery(smile): By the way, can we talk about the fact that you call your fans 'Luckies'?
Lucas(happy): They like it. And it makes them feel more familiar...
Lucas: Less like a nameless, faceless mass.
Narrator: You both fall silent for a moment, lost in your own thoughts.
Narrator: When you glance at Lucas again, you notice that his smile is gone.
Avery: What are you thinking about?
Lucas(shy): Oh. It's nothing.
Avery: You know you're a horrible liar, right?
Narrator: He runs a hand through his hair, letting the water drip down over his face.
Lucas(sad): I can't help thinking that what happened tonight was my fault.
Avery(sad): Lucas...
A. You did nothing wrong.
B. Let's forget it happened.
A
Avery(sad): Blaming yourself won't fix anything.
Lucas(sad): I know. But if I'd gone to Sam sooner, or warned you to be more careful...
Avery: It wouldn't have changed anything. It's not your fault.

Lucas(happy): Give me a minute. I want to look at you.
Narrator: Your face heats up as Lucas stares deeply into your eyes, his thumb stroking your cheek.
Avery(shy): What happened to giving me anything I want?
Lucas(smile): You're right. I'm being selfish.
Narrator: Finally, his lips meet yours. The kiss is slow and thorough, taking your breath away.
Lucas(happy): I can be generous too...
Narrator: Lucas runs his hands over your shoulders and down your arms...
Narrator: The heat from the water enhances every sensation, his touch warm and soft.
Avery(happy): Mm, this is better...
Narrator: You kiss him harder, letting your hands explore the planes of his body.
Narrator: You trace teasing patterns on his skin, and he lets out a soft moan.

B. To slow down.

Narrator: Lucas pulls back to meet your gaze, his eyes bright and full of emotion.

Narrator: You gasp as pleasure sparks through you, arching into his touch.
Avery(happy): Don't stop...
Narrator: You reach for him, catching his lips in a passionate kiss as your bodies move together...

Lucas(smile): And for the finishing touch...
Narrator: He carefully pours two glasses of champagne, handing one to you.
Avery(smile): Cheers!

Narrator: He starts to knead your muscles with sure, steady movements.
Narrator: Immediately, you feel your body starting to unwind.
Lucas: I have a lot of muscle pain...
Lucas: It's expected, when you're practicing choreography and spending hours on flights.
Avery(sad): I didn't know. Is it bad?
Lucas: I can usually ignore it. But when it flares up, I have to go to a professional.
Lucas(happy): Good news is I've picked up a trick or two.
Narrator: His hands move lower down your spine, seeking out each sore spot.
Avery(happy): Lucas, that feels amazing...
Avery(happy): If I fall asleep like this, I'm holding you responsible.
Lucas(happy): Go right ahead. I'll make sure you don't drown.

Sam(happy): And the limo is much more <i>private.</i> But it's up to you.
Avery: (If we take the limo, it could help us work out this unresolved tension...)
Avery(happy): (And this could be my chance to take our relationship to the next level!)
Avery: I want to...
A. Take the limo! (Cost: 25 Diamond)

Sam(sad): If there's one thing I can't stand, it's feeling helpless.
Sam(angry): Standing outside that door, knowing it would just look more suspicious if I interrupted...
Avery(surprise): Was it really that risky? No one could see me.
Sam(sad): Fans can pick up the smallest sounds, or catch a reflection in a window...
Sam(sad): I know it's hard, but the last thing we want is to give the stalker more ammo.
Avery(sad): So, what... you want to put me in a bulletproof room somewhere?
Avery(sad): Keep me locked away so I'll never get hurt?
Sam: Tempting.
Avery: I'm not as breakable as you think, Sam...
Avery:  You don't need to treat me like I'll shatter from just one touch.
Narrator: Sam leans back against the leather seat, raising an eyebrow at you.
Sam: You sure about that?
Narrator: You roll your eyes and shift closer to him on the seat.

Narrator: Sam wraps his arms around you as your lips move hungrily against his.

Avery(surprise): Whoa!
Narrator: Your back hits the plush leather seat. Sam hovers over you with a smirk.
Sam(smile): Only because I let you.
