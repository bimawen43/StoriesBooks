Layla: Can you keep this safe for me?
Grandma: Of course... You're going back to the ocean, aren't you?
Grandma(sad): When do you go back, dear?
Layla(sad): ...Tonight. Before sunset.
Grandma(surprise): Then I'm glad I came when I did! I nearly missed you.
Narrator: She heaves a sigh, worry weighing on her shoulders.
Grandma(sad): I hoped to keep you safe from all of this.
Grandma(sad): The mer world is beautiful but it is also dangerous.
Layla(sad): I know.

A. The human world is the same.
B. I wish I didn't have to go.

Layla(sad): Grandma... Do you think there's any way you can do the spell again?
Layla(sad): Put me back to the way I was so I can go back to my human life.
Grandma(sad): I wish I could... But I don't have nearly that much power.
Grandma(sad): Even back then, I couldn't have done it alone. And now...
Layla(sad): I understand...

Layla*Think: Maybe I can find a way to change myself back.

Narrator: Zale smiles up at you from the water, a hand extended, ready to pull you back into the world of mer beneath the sea.
Narrator: You hesitate.
Layla(sad): Do you know... when I'll be able to come back here? 
Zale(sad): I'm not sure... Could be a few days, if we rush to the sea witch and back, but...
Layla(sad): Longer, if we're going to try and learn what's happening. 
Narrator: You turn to look back at the beach house, some of the lights still on in the rooms where your friends are still awake.

Narrator: You slip off your shoes and join him, splashing through the water until you can sit beside him.
Layla(sad): Thank you. This whole... 'Living two lives' thing...
(sld_09_14_DP1_living_two_lives)
A. It's a lot harder than I thought.
B. Can be a little exciting, even if it's exhausting.
A 
Zale(sad): Yeah... I think I told you that I work with a lot of mer who spend time on land.
Layla: You mentioned it a little...
Zale(sad): All of them struggle with this. You're not the only one.
Narrator: He puts a friendly hand on your shoulder and gives it a light squeeze.
B 
Zale(smile): Exciting, huh?
Layla(smile): Well... I feel like I'm some kind of secret spy sometimes. I have this whole double life...
Layla(sad): Lying to everyone wears me out, though. I'm not cut out for this sort of thing.

Zale: I'm excited for you to see more of the ocean, learn more about what it means to be mer...
Zale(sad): I sometimes forget how much of your life really belongs on land.
Layla(smile): Oh, you know... Just my friends, my family, my school... My whole life...
Layla(smile): What's funny... When I was a little kid, I wanted to be a mermaid.
Zale(smile): Cause of the movie?
Layla(happy): Of course! I would wrap a blanket around my legs, pretending it was a tail.
Layla(smile): Guess I got my wish, huh.
Zale: {Layla Name}... You were always a mermaid. The whole time.
Layla(smile): Yeah, but it doesn't feel like it. This all feels like... still very not real.
Narrator: You listen to the sound of the waves as they swell against the beach, thinking about the world you're leaving and the one you're going back to.
Layla*Think: I want to...
(sld_09_14_DP3_thanks_zale)
A. Kiss him.

Zale(smile): For what it's worth...
Zale(smile): That seemed very real to me. 
Layla(shy): Yeah... It did...
Narrator: He grins at you, then sighs a little sadly.
