Layla(surprise): So, then...
(sld_03_10_the_sea_witch)
A. The sea witch isn't evil?
B. She can really help me go home?
A
Narrator: Zale playfully bumps the top of your head with his fist.
Zale(happy): She can be kinda grumpy if you catch her too early in the morning, but...
Tai(smile): I wouldn't say she's evil. Although working with magic so closely does make people a little... eccentric...
Layla(shy): Oh...
B
Tai: She can transform you into a human using the same method Zale used to visit you.
Tai(sad): Although I'm not sure if it will work as easily on a human...
Zale: Either way, she's our best bet at getting answers.

Narrator: Tai stretches and yawns.
Tai: I think I'm going to head to bed, too. Zale... You know where the bed things are?
Zale(smile): Yep. I got it.
Narrator: Tai waves to you, then slips up the hatch to join his family...
Narrator: ...Leaving you and Zale alone in the room.
Layla(surprise): So, um...
(sld_03_11_where_to_sleep)
A. How do mermaids sleep? I don't see beds...
B. You and Tai seem like really close friends...
C. Do you live here, too?
A 
Zale(smile): No beds the way you're thinking... We'd float away if we were lying down like that.
Zale(smile): But just like the chairs are dome-shaped, we have sleeping bags over there...
Narrator: He points to what looks like a small tube or cave made out of soft materials.
Zale(smile): They're great. You'll like them.

*Gain LEARNED_ABOUT_STEADFASTS
Zale(smile): Tai is my Steadfast. It's a bond much deeper than friendship. More than brothers, even...
Layla(surprise): You mentioned that before... What is it, exactly?
Zale: In our culture, warriors come in pairs. You always have someone watching your back, a partner to rely on.
Narrator: Zale gestures to the swirling tattoo on his shoulder.
Zale: There's a ritual, a ceremony with some magic involved, where we were both marked with matching ink.
Zale(happy): A pair of Steadfasts moves in sync with each other. They train together from a young age, but it's more than that.
Zale(smile): It's... kind of hard to explain. But he's my partner. The only person closer to him would be his wife.
C
Zale(happy): I stay here sometimes... But this is just a temporary outpost for when Tai's on assignment.
Zale(smile): Both of us have actual homes in the city.
Layla(surprise): There's a city? Like... A real mermaid city?
Zale(happy): Haha... Yeah? Of course.
Layla(shy): Yeah, you're right... of course...
Zale(smile): There are towns, too... The sea witch we're going to visit lives just outside of a small village east of here.
***
Layla(smile): Oh... I see...
Narrator: Zale watches you with a grin, then heads for the door.
Zale(smile): Come on... I want to show you something.
Narrator: You awkwardly make it across the room to his side.

Layla(angry): Swimming is so frustrating...
Zale(happy): You'll get there. Don't worry about it.
Zale(smile): I've got you. I won't let you get lost.

Layla(surprise): Oh wow! This is amazing!
Zale(happy): Isn't it? Lisi's been tending to it as her own personal garden.
Zale(smile): The coral wasn't quite so vibrant last time I was here..
Narrator: He lets go of your arm and you try swimming up to different sea plants and animals.
Layla(happy): This is so beautiful...
Narrator: You look over and see him smiling at you fondly.

Zale(shy): Yeah, sorry... I got a little carried away there...

Layla(shy): Yeah...
Narrator: He presses a kiss to your temple, twining your fingers together.
Layla(smile): Thank you for bringing me here... It's so beautiful...
Zale(smile): Will you smack me if I tell you it's not as beautiful as you are?
Layla(shy): ...I might.
Zale(happy): Glad I didn't say it, then.

Zale(happy): Seeing you with a tail was driving me a little crazy...
Narrator: Zale's tongue traces your lips and you cling to him.
Layla(smile): My tail, huh? So you've got some kind of tail fetish?
Narrator: Zale laughs as he kisses you, the warm sound filling up your chest.
Zale(happy): Hey. It's no different than a guy on land being into legs.
Narrator: You swoosh your tail through the water in what you hope is a sexy wiggle...

Zale(happy): Here...
Narrator: Zale leans into you, pushing you against the cave wall.
Narrator: He kisses you hard, holding onto the wall to keep you pressed tight against him.
Zale(smile): Mmm...
