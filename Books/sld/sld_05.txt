Zale: {Layla Name}... This is the sea witch.
Amara(smile): Hello, {Layla Name}.
Amara(happy): I've been expecting you. 
Layla(surprise): Expecting me? 
(sld_05_01_expecting here)
A. You can see the future?
B. Do you know what happened?
A 
Narrator: The sea witch throws back her head and laughs.

Amara(happy): Of course not.
Layla(surprise): Then how ——
B

Layla(sad): Do you know who did this to me? If you've been waiting...
Amara(sad): I'm sorry, my dear, but you misunderstand...

Amara: When I felt the shockwave from your magic, I knew they'd find you and bring you to me. 
Amara(smile): I'm the only sea witch around for miles, so...
>
Zale: You could feel that magic from all the way out here?
Amara: This entire region, coast to depths, felt the aftershock.

Amara: {*Shock Change you back...?}
Layla: Yes. I need to go home. They saw me fall into the ocean and disappear... 
Layla(sad): Who knows what they think happened to me?
Narrator: Amara raises an eyebrow and cocks her head, looking at you like an interesting puzzle. 
>>>
Amara: If you changed yourself mer, can you not change back on your own?
>>
Layla: No...
(sld_05_02_change_back)
A. I can't change back. I don't have magic!
B. Someone did this to me against my will!
A 
Amara(surprise): You have no magic? That's not right...
>
Narrator: She inspects you carefully, then turns to rummage in her things, muttering to herself.
Amara: A spell that powerful... It wasn't a simple transformation spell. It was much bigger than that...
Amara: But if you didn't do it, then someone must have used magic on you instead...
B 
Amara(sad): Against your will? So you didn't know it was going to happen?
Layla(sad): I'm telling you... I simply fell into the ocean and suddenly...
>
Narrator: You gesture down at your tail swishing through the water.
Layla(sad): Instant mermaid.
***
Zale(sad): Who would have the power to do that? Are there land witches like you who ——
Amara(happy): Land witches? Ha. Not likely.
Narrator: The witch laughs as she digs through her belongings, still looking for something.
Amara(happy): Ah, forgive me... Land witches have so little power.
Amara: They hide behind dried weeds and drier books, fearing power too much to take it for themselves.
Layla: Um... Okay...
(sld_05_03_the_land_witch)
A. Then how did this happen?
B. Who could have done this, then?
*** 
Narrator: Amara straights and turns to you, her keen eyes studying you closely.
>>>
Amara: So according to you...
Amara: You are human. And you were artificially given fins and gills to temporarily become mer, yes?
Layla(sad): Yes...?
>>
Amara: I don't think that is the case. Such a spell leaves a trace, a magical residue... 
Amara: Like an oily film after eating. Any witch could reach out and touch it, dispel it in an instant.
Amara: But you?
>
Narrator: She holds up a vial of liquid clouded like purple mud.
Amara: Zale, you know what this is, yes?
Zale(surprise): It ends the human transformation immediately. I've used it a few times myself.
Amara(smile): It's a spell for purity. It will remove any transformation and return someone to their true form.
Narrator: Without warning, Amara flings the murky vial at you.

(sld_05_04_spell_for_purity)
A. That's dangerous! You could've killed me!
B. What do you mean 'if' I'm human?
A 
Amara: But it didn't kill you. Nothing happened because there is no human spell to wipe away.
B
Amara(sad): What I mean is that spell reveals your true form. When it was used on you...
Amara(sad): Your true form remained a mermaid.

Zale(sad): We can still get you back home with a transformation spell to make you human again.

Amara: Transformation spells usually last for about a week before they need a witch to renew them again. 
Layla(surprise): A week?! That's barely any time at all...
Layla(sad): My home, my college... It's a six-hour drive to get here.
