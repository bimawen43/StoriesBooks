A. How could they do that?!
B. Why haven't they been stopped?!

Narrator: Zale's brow furrows in anger as he tries to calm down.
Zale(angry): I don't know. I always dismissed it as just a rumor.
Zale(angry): Tell me what Caden did to you, exactly.
Narrator: You think back, remembering that day behind the witch's house.

Layla(surprise): He sang to me... The words were about being calm, relaxing...
Layla: He started right off with the singing. It was kind of weird...
Narrator: Zale's frustrated huff releases a thin stream of bubbles.
Zale(angry): So the rumors are true. The Deep Sea clan has an elite army of sirens.
Layla(surprise): Wait. Hold on... All those things you were saying before...
Layla(sad): Kids being taken, forced to train as some kind of psychic soldiers...
Layla(sad): Are you saying...
(sld_10_10_army of sirens)
A. That happened to Caden?
B. Caden does that to people?
A
Narrator: A sad look crosses Zale's face as he nods.
Zale(sad): They're just rumors, they might not be real, but... Yes. 
B
Zale(sad): No, {Layla Name}. He might have been one of the children they took.

Narrator: A sad silence settles over you as you swim through open water.
Zale: We're almost there.
Narrator: You peer ahead and can see the town and the sea witch's home in the distance.

Amara: Deep Sea soldiers.
Layla(sad)*Think: Caden?
Narrator: As if she can read your mind, the sea witch laughs.
Amara(smile): Don't worry, it wasn't that brooding shadow who was lurking in my gardens.
Layla(shy): What?

Narrator: Amara nods, a little disappointed. 
Amara: They were a brute squad of Deep Sea soldiers. They came looking for you.
Amara(sad): They had a magical device with them. It carried a trace of someone's magic.
Amara(sad): A witch could sense the unique magic signature in that trace...
Amara(sad): And use it to identify the magic user whose essence was inside.
Narrator: You try to understand where she's going with this.
Layla(sad): So it's like... they had someone's magical fingerprint?
Layla(sad): And a witch could compare it and know it's the same person?
Narrator: Amara tilts her head, puzzled.
Amara: Finger... print? What is that?
Layla(shy)*Think: I guess fingerprints wouldn't last long underwater...
Layla(surprise): Um, nevermind. So why did the soldiers bring the device to you?
Amara(smile): Because I'm a very powerful witch.
Amara(smile): And I live closest to the location of your magic blast.
Narrator: Her expression darkens, and she focuses on you, intent and serious.
Amara: I now know why King Avos has been searching for you so desperately.

Layla(sad): That seems sort of vague...
Amara: Trust me. Close your eyes and ask the room to speak to you.
