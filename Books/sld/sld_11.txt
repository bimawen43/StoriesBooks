Amara(sad): It's because their king, King Avos, thinks you're his daughter, the long lost princess.

Amara: Others thought the queen had a secret lover and ran off to be with him.

Layla(sad)*Think: Wouldn't I be safer if I stayed on land? The King can't find me there...
Layla(sad)*Think: Even if I can't transform... Staying close to land would be safer, wouldn't it?

Layla(sad)*Think: Grandma told me everything she knows, didn't she?
Layla(sad)*Think: Maybe she didn't know I was a princess... Or she would have told me, right?

Layla(surprise)*Think: Oh! These look like potions! I wonder what they do...
Narrator: The labels are in another language, but one has an image of a figure shouting, with another figure hearing them from a distance.
Narrator: The other depicts a figure whose body appears split down the middle - one half is mer, the other human.
Layla(surprise)*Think: This must be it! A transformation potion like I took last time!
Layla(happy)*Think: With this, I can go back home to land!
Narrator: You slip the potion into your pocket, excited.

Narrator: You leave the second potion behind, taking only the one with the transformation label

Layla(happy)*Think: Now there's nothing stopping me from going back. I'll just leave a note for Zale...
Narrator: You glance around until you find what looks like a noteboard and a pen.

Letter What luck! I can make it back to land on my own.

Narrator: As you pull away, his eyes drop to your mouth. He cups the back of your head, pulling you close and kissing you again, deeper and more passionately.
