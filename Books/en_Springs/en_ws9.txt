Benjamin(smile): Don't worry. Just a fender bender.
Danielle(smile): All right, then. Be safe.
Benjamin(smile): I heard cheers! Did Alan win?
Danielle(smile): Yes, he won. But he's a little bit disappointed that you aren't here.
Benjamin(happy): Well, I'll apologize to him for that. But right now, can you do me a favor?
Danielle(surprise): What?
Benjamin(sad): Can you come here all by yourself? Right now!
Danielle(surprise): What's the matter?
Benjamin(smile): I made an important discovery, it's about...
Narrator: Suddenly, you hear a strong static, as if Benjamin's phone doesn't get a good signal.
Danielle(surprise): Are you alright, Ben? 
Benjamin(smile): My phone is running low. I'm on an abandoned highway north of town.
Benjamin(smile): Come here! It's too complicated to explain on the phone.

Alan(surprise): Ben? So he's absent from my celebration because he's busy with a secret mission?
Danielle*Think: Hmmm... What should I do...
(ws_09_01_DP1_tell_alan)
A. Lie to him.
B. Tell him the truth.

Danielle(happy): Don't worry, I think the tow truck is on the way.
Danielle(smile): By the way, I need to pick him up right now.
B
Danielle(smile): Ben's car broke down and he's waiting for me on the highway north of town.
Alan(surprise): That's strange. The highway up north has been abandoned for ages. Why did he go there?

Danielle(smile): I'm not sure, but he sounds quite anxious. I'm sorry... I'll need to leave early...

Benjamin(smile): I'm sorry! But will you let me tell you about my discovery before you get mad?
Narrator: Benjamin smiles smugly, which makes you roll your eyes.
Danielle(happy): Fine, great detective. I'm all ears.

Benjamin(smile): I think that snail mail is too slow, so I drove to the laboratory this afternoon...
Danielle(surprise): What did you find?
Benjamin(smile): It will surprise you! The resutls said that the blood on the baseball bat came from two sources.
Benjamin(smile): One is Alan. And the other is from a human... partially.
Danielle(surprise): ...
(ws_09_01_DP2_human_blood)
A. Partially? What do you mean?
B. Human? But even the shot couldn't hurt it!
A
Benjamin(angry): It means, whatever the monster is now, it used to be human. Somehow, it mutated.
Danielle(surprise): Mutated? Did they tell you how it happened?
Benjamin(sad): I'm sorry they didn't...
B
Danielle(surprise): I touched him! He has bristles!
Danielle(surprise): This can't possibly be the result of natural evolution of humans, right?!
Benjamin(sad): Naturally. Genetic mutation wouldn't explain why it has those mysterious green eyes, either.
Benjamin(sad): And why it's so strong.

Benjamin(angry): The researchers told me this wasn't the first time they found a mutated blood sample.
Benjamin(sad): They ever found the people who died in the Forbidden Forest had a similar mutation.
Benjamin(sad): The only difference was the extent of their mutation.

A. Didn't they report this to the police?
B. What's the hell in the Forbidden Forest?

Narrator: Thinking of something, you and Benjamin exchange a look.
Danielle(angry): This doesn't seem like an accident to me! What if... someone is trying to cover up the truth?
>
Benjamin(sad): Then this person must be more influential than we initially thought.
B
Danielle(angry): People don't mutate for no reason!
Danielle(sad): Maybe this is the real reason why the Forbidden Forest is blocked off!
Benjamin(angry): Yes, that's what I wanted to say...

Benjamin(angry): This is a conspiracy! A giant conspiracy that shrouds the entire town!

Narrator: Benjamin pauses as fear and anger alternate on his face.
Benjamin(sad): Actually, I'm even suspecting that someone wants to kill me because of this!

Benjamin(sad): I... I suspect that there's a mole among us!
Danielle(surprise): That's impossible...

A. I don't believe Joe would betray us.
B. I don't believe Alan would betray us.
C. I believe in my friends.
A
Benjamin(angry): Then it must be Alan...
Benjamin(angry): Don't you think the timing of his appearance in the Forbidden Forest was suspicious?
Danielle(sad): But he saved us!
Benjamin(angry): That could have been a trick to get close to us. As Sherlock Holmes would say...

Benjamin(sad): "when you have eliminated the impossible,whatever remains,however improbable..."
Benjamin(sad): "Must be the truth."
Narrator: You are silent for a moment and shake your head.
Danielle(sad): Ben, I don't want to judge him until I confirm it with my own eyes...
B
Benjamin(sad): So you're suspecting Joe?
Danielle(surprise): Joe?! But if he wanted to stop us, why would he be taking all those risks with us?
Benjamin(sad): That's what I'm confused about too...
>
Danielle(sad): Maybe we shouldn't suspect anyone... they're nice guys...
C
Benjamin(sad): But...
Danielle(sad): Ben, trust is difficult to establish but so easy to destroy.

Danielle(smile): I don't want to suspect my friends because of a <i>set up</i> car crash that we have no evidence for!

Benjamin(sad): Okay then... I'll respect your decision. Maybe I'm just being too suspicious...
Narrator: Benjamin shrugs and looks a little dejected. You walk over and hug him warmly.

Letter \n \n \n \n \n \n \n After days of treatment, James, who was found beside the forest, came out of his coma. \n Among all the people found beside the forest, he was the only one that survived.
Letter Many residents of the town visited him to show their concern. However, when the police questioned him, he said that he had forgotten everything. \n He left town yesterday afternoon. \n Doctor Bentley was the only one to see him off.
Letter when asked about the whereabouts of James, Doctor Bentley refused to comment, and it wasn't long before she resigned from her position at the pharmaceutical company. \n

Danielle(surprise): Look, it's a 1982 newspaper. But it says "mysterious forest", not the Forbidden Forest.
Joe(smile): There is only one forest in town. It must mean the Forbidden Forest.
Danielle(sad): But in 1982, it was still an ordinary forest.
Danielle(angry): And... look here, it says "A lot of people were being attacked in the Forbidden Forest back then."
Danielle(sad): But Doctor Bentley saved a person called James before she left the pharma company.
Joe(smile): Pharma company... Genetic mutation... Survivor of the Forbidden Forest...
Joe(smile): Everything's falling into place! This is the information we've been looking for!
Danielle(sad): But it's been almost 40 years. We don't know if they're still alive.

Benjamin(smile): ...Maybe I can find out.
Danielle(surprise): How?
Benjamin(smile): Bentley. Such a unique name. My neighbor has the same surname.
Danielle(smile): She's your neighbor? That's great! Let's go and visit her!
Narrator: Benjamin frowns with reluctance.
Danielle(surprise): What's wrong?
Benjamin(sad): Don't make fun of me, ok? But I always thought she was... a witch that likes to eat children!

Danielle(surprise): What? Witch?!
