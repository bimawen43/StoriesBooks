Narrator: Benjamin winks at you.
Danielle(sad): No. We went to the police station.
Benjamin(surprise): What? Did you do something NC-17?
B
Benjamin(surprise): Why? What did you do?
Danielle(sad): It's just... Sorry, I don't know how to say it.
Danielle(sad): I really don't want to be the one to break the news to you.

Danielle(sad): Gavin's dead. Joe and I went to the police station to give a statement.
Benjamin(surprise): What?
Narrator: Benjamin is astonished. He seems unable to understand what you just said. You put your hand on his shoulder.

Danielle(sad): Ben, are you all right?
Benjamin(surprise): Gavin is... dead?
Danielle(sad): Yes.
Benjamin(angry): That's impossible! What the hell, {Danielle Name}? 
Benjamin(angry): Don't make sick jokes like that, even with me.
Danielle(sad): I didn't want to believe it, either. But it's real. I saw his dead body myself.
Narrator: Benjamin glares at you. He stands up, shoving his desk away, and storms out of the room. 
>
Danielle(surprise): Hey, Ben! Where are you going?
Benjamin(angry): To see Gavin.
Narrator: You can't bring yourself to stop Benjamin. You just watch him dash off.
Danielle(sad): I feel awful, having to break the news to Benjamin like this.
Joe(sad): It's not your fault. You've gone through a lot yourself.

Narrator: Principal's Voice | As you mourn your classmate, please remain rational and follow the pact of Spring Paradise.

Benjamin(cry): He was supposed to play basketball with me after school. We agreed on it yesterday.

Danielle(sad): Is there anything, anything I can do to make you feel better?
Benjamin(cry): I just can't... can't believe... Gavin's... He's supposed to be standing here with me.
Benjamin(cry): We were going to play basketball after school.
Danielle(sad): You know, Gavin is still here in our hearts. As long as we love him, he's here with us.
Narrator: Tears flood Benjamin's eyes. He covers his face in sorrow.
Benjamin(cry): Why did it have to be Gavin...
Danielle(sad): I'm sorry. Do whatever you need to make yourself feel better. I'm here for you.

Narrator: You sit beside Benjamin in the small stairway. After a while, Benjamin raises his head and wipes away his tears.
Benjamin(sad): I'm all right now. {Danielle Name}, can you tell me what happened?
Danielle(sad): Are you sure you want to know, Ben?
Benjamin(sad): I need to know. It's Gavin.
Danielle(sad): Okay.
Narrator: You hold Benjamin's hand and tell him what you saw last night.
Narrator: --The scratches, the wire mesh, the blood, and also, the pair of green eyes you saw in the woods.

Benjamin(angry): I knew it!
Danielle(surprise): What?
Benjamin(angry): Gavin told me he was investigating the Forbidden Forest.
Benjamin(angry): And that he was close to a big secret. 
Benjamin(angry): Damn it!
Benjamin(angry): Why did he always insist, "There's something wrong with it. I must know what it is."
Narrator: It seems like Benjamin isn't talking to you, but talking to his past self and Gavin.
Danielle(surprise): Calm down, Ben. Tell me more.
>>>
Benjamin(angry): Everyone in this town knows. Anyone who goes into the Forest will end up dead.
Benjamin(angry): No one has ever made it out alive. No one.
Benjamin(angry): When the body is found, there are always mysterious scratches on it.
Benjamin(angry): That's why everyone believes the Forbidden Forest is cursed. It has a monster that eats people.
Benjamin(angry): Anyone who dares to go inside will bring misfortune to themselves and everyone around them.
Danielle(surprise): But I got out alive. Is there really a monster?
>>
Benjamin(sad): No one knows.
Benjamin(sad): Every person who's ever dared to investigate it is dead--Gavin, your uncle Owen, everyone.

Benjamin(sad): Yes. Everyone. Over the years, a lot of people have been found dead outside the Forbidden Forest.

Benjamin(surprise): You did know?
Danielle(sad): My mom never mentioned she had a brother. But this name sounds so familiar...

Narrator: Suddenly, you remember the VCR camera and a thought crosses your mind.
Danielle(surprise): Do you remember when I went into the Forbidden Forest by accident?
Benjamin(smile): Of course, how could I forget how brave you were.
Danielle(sad): I picked up a VCR camera there!
Danielle(sad): A man named Owen Miller snuck into the forest many years ago, just like Gavin!
Benjamin(surprise): My god! Why have you never mentioned it?
Danielle(sad): I didn't know Owen was my uncle...
Benjamin(surprise): So... what happened to him while he was in the forest?

Benjamin(surprise): Seriously? You mean there is a real monster in the Forbidden Forest?!
Danielle(sad): Perhaps, because I heard the scream of the monster.
B
Danielle(angry): Sorry, I don't know. I wish I could pick the VCR camera...
Benjamin(sad): What a pity!

Narrator: The two of you look at each other for a moment and sigh.
Danielle(sad): Wait, something... doesn't feel right.
Benjamin(surprise): What?

Danielle(angry): Why did the monster attack everyone that tried to approach the Forbidden Forest?
Benjamin(surprise): You mean it's not a coincidence?
Danielle(angry): Yeah, Joe told me there's a mysterious power responsible for maintaining order...
Danielle(angry): And it wants everyone to tremble at the name of the Forbidden Forest!
Danielle(angry): Maybe someone killed Gavin and is using the monster to cover up the crime!
Benjamin(angry): Damn it! We don't have enough clues. We need to find an answer.
Benjamin(sad): I can't let Gavin "die in an accident."
Narrator: Benjamin frowns. He stands up and paces anxiously, pondering.
>
Danielle(surprise): So, what are you going to do?
Benjamin: Gavin had been investigating the Forbidden Forest. 
Benjamin: He must have left something behind. I want to check his locker. Will you come with me?

Benjamin(sad): {Danielle Name}, you don't understand.
Benjamin(sad): People in this town will never look into anything related to the Forbidden Forest.
Danielle(surprise): What about the cops?
Benjamin(angry): They're Spring Paradise's cops. They don't care.
Benjamin(angry): I'm not going to risk losing what Gavin traded his life for.
Danielle(sad): I won't stop you. But Ben, I can't go with you.

Benjamin(smile): Gavin would be glad to have a friend like you. Stay here. I'll be back in a second.
Narrator: You wait by the locker, trying to look casual. Eventually, Benjamin hurries back with a bag.
Danielle(sad): So how are we supposed to get into Gavin's locker?
>
Narrator: You point at the lock. Benjamin proudly opens his bag, displaying all kinds of tools.

Danielle(surprise): Where did you get these things?
Benjamin(smile): They're Gavin's. He taught me a lot of things.

Narrator: You see a faint smile on Benjamin's face. He looks like he's remembering something, something nice.
Narrator: Benjamin begins trying to pick the lock with a piece of iron wire. You stand beside him and keep a lookout.
Narrator: You hear the sound of light footsteps mixed in with the murmur of conversation. Gradually, the sounds become clearer.
Narrator: You peek around the corner and notice Officer Brian walking towards you with the principal.

Narrator*Top: Brian | We should find out what Gavin knew. I don't want anyone poking around in his locker.
Narrator: You turn back and look at Benjamin. He looks like he's still struggling with the lock.

Narrator: You take a crowbar from Benjamin's bag.
Benjamin(surprise): That thing would make a lot of noise.
Danielle: Don't overthink it. Just take the easy way out.
Narrator: You fit the crowbar into the locker's door and look at Benjamin.
Danielle(smile): Watch out!
Narrator: Benjamin nods at you. You take a deep breath and pry the locker open. It makes a huge racket as it opens, cracking the lock on the door.
Benjamin(surprise): You're so strong...

Narrator: Brian | Who's there?

Danielle(angry): No way. I'm not some kind of freak.
Benjamin(sad): ...Neither am I.
Danielle(angry): Shhh... shut up. Do you want Officer Brian to hear us?
Narrator: You hear rapid footsteps coming for you. You look around. No one else is in the locker room, but there's nowhere for you to hide.
Narrator: The footsteps slow down, but they still seem to be coming closer and closer to you.
Benjamin: Come here.
Narrator: Benjamin takes you to the furthest corner of the room, opens an empty locker, and slips in. You look around to find another unlocked locker.
Benjamin: There's no time.

Narrator: Benjamin pulls you into the empty locker. The two of you just manage to squeeze into the tiny space. Your head knocks against his chest.

Narrator: Benjamin whispers back to you. His breath is hot on your skin, and you shyly move away from him. 
Benjamin: Let me see what's going on outside.
Danielle: ...I wanna see it, too.
Narrator: You try to turn around, but the locker is too narrow. You nearly kick the door open. Ben quickly grabs your waist.
Benjamin: Careful. Don't touch the door.
Narrator: You maneuver around until you can see outside through the slit.
Narrator: Brian has already entered the room. He's scanning it carefully. When he turns towards you, your eyes lock with his.

Danielle(smile): You know something about the forest or... the monster, don't you?
Narrator: You look straight into Mavis's eyes and see a flicker of doubt.
Mavis(sad): Don't make this any harder for me. {Danielle Name}, I can't tell you...
Danielle(surprise): You're one of my best friends...

A. What the hell do you mean by <i>guardian</i>?
B. How do you know that?
A

Mavis(sad): Literally. Like, it guards something in the Forbidden Forest.
Danielle(surprise): What's that?
Mavis(sad): I don't know. My parents didn't tell me. 
Mavis(sad): They just told me that the monster took the forest as its territory!
B
>>
Mavis(sad): My parents told me...that the forest was the monster's territory!
Benjamin(sad): Hang on, there's something I don't understand.
Benjamin(angry): ...when you say territory.
Benjamin(angry): Do you mean that the monster was the guardian of the forest for the local natives?
Mavis(angry): I can't answer that. Even my parents immigrated to Spring Paradise.

Danielle(sad): After all, we know why the monster attacked those people...
Danielle(sad): It thinks the people who approach the Forbidden Forest invaded its territory!
Danielle(smile): Thank you. That means a lot to us, Mavis.
*Mavis NERVE +2
Mavis(smile): Gavin helped me a lot. And I knew this was the right thing to do.
Mavis(sad): I just did't have enough courage... I'm a coward!

Danielle*Think(smile): She needs to be comforted...

A. Give her a hug.
B. Praise her courage.

Narrator: You put her head on your shoulder and comfort her gently.
Danielle(smile): Listen, what would life be without adventures?
Danielle(smile): As long as you can overcome your fears, you can do anything you set your mind to.

Danielle(angry): Can you believe it? She asked me to stay away from every man in this town, and yet...
Joe(sad): Maybe they're just old friends.
Danielle(angry): Old friends? Please. I can see it in their eyes. Something must be going on between them. 
Joe(sad): I hope not. The person standing there is my father.
Narrator: You look at Joe. He looks as grave as you. You can't help but walk forward and pull your mom away.

Danielle(angry): But he's also the father of my friend and the husband of someone else!
Narrator: Your mom's face turns red with anger.

Danielle: I'm listening.
Clare: I grew up in Spring Paradise. I had a lot of friends back then.
Clare: I thought this happiness would last forever and ever.
Clare(sad): But everything changed after your Uncle Owen died.
Clare(sad): My father was so grief-stricken that he couldn't accept it was an accident.
Clare(sad): With each day that passed he just became touchier and more ill-tempered.
Clare(sad): I was scared. But there was nothing I could do except mourn!

Danielle(sad): Now I understand why you left this place.

Clare(sad): The people in this town... they hated people related to the Forbidden Forest.
Clare(sad): They turned their backs on me and refused to talk to me.
Clare(sad): They ignored me completely. I was the outcast of this town.
Clare(sad): As for my so-called friends, they betrayed me just to protect themselves.
Clare(sad): They bullied me, threw trash into my yard, attacked me in the bathroom and poured drinks on me...

Clare(sad): It's been 20 years but I've never forgotten the pain. Not for a single second.
Clare(smile): Back then, it was just Grant. He was the only one who treated me like before.
Clare(sad): He gave up on his dream of becoming a musician, and gave me all of his savings. 
Clare(sad): He sent me to college to get me out of this horrible place.
Clare(smile): He was my redemption. It was all because of him. Then I met your bastard father and had you.
Danielle(sad): Mom, I'll apologize to Uncle Grant for my rudeness tomorrow.
Narrator: Your mother smiles in relief.
Clare(sad): {Danielle Name}, that's why I want you to stay away from other people in this town.

Danielle: They're even investigating it.
Narrator: Clare's face turns pale.
Clare(sad): {Danielle Name}, that's even worse!
Clare(sad): Investigating the Forbidden Forest will put anyone who dares to do so in danger.
Clare(sad): And their families, even their friends!
