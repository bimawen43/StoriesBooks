Narrator: You and Benjamin hide behind the corner.
Mavis(angry): Is it worth it, distorting the truth for money?
Mavis(sad): You're ignoring the truth of Gavin's death!
Narrator*Top: Brian | Enough! Stop!
Narrator: Brian shows up at the end of the corridor. He angrily strides towards Mavis.
Danielle(surprise)*Think: Officer Brian?

Brian(angry): We received a call. Someone is starting rumors at school and endangering public safety.
Brian(angry): Looks like that person is you, isn't it? Miss Mavis?
Narrator: Brian glares at her, furious. It looks like he might hit her. Mavis takes a step back, fear all over her face.
Danielle(angry): It's not a rumor!
Narrator: You stand up, striding forward in anger. Benjamin walks out behind you.
Narrator: Brian turns towards to you. His eyes are burning with fury.
Brian(angry): You again!
Brian: Everybody in town knows that Gavin died in an accident.
Danielle(angry): Only because you lied to them! You pathetic cowards!
Danielle(angry): You're afraid of being killed by whatever is in the Forbidden Forest, aren't you?
Narrator: You see a familiar, horrible expression in Brian's eyes. But you're not afraid at all.
Brian: Since you're so sure about that, how about you tell me more down at the police station?
Benjamin: I'll go with them!

Brian(angry): What do you think the police station is? An amusement park?
Brian(angry): Stay here. Your friends are coming with me.

Narrator: Benjamin stares at him, stupefied. It looks like he's about to start an argument with Brian.
Danielle: Don't worry, Ben.
Narrator: You pat Benjamin's shoulder.
Benjamin: I'll come by after school. I just need to know you're okay.
Brian: Hey! Save the lovey-dovey stuff! Do you need to kiss goodbye, too?
Brian(angry): Move your ass! Don't waste my time!
Danielle(angry): Shut up, meat-head!
Narrator: You want to say more to Benjamin. But Brian grabs you by the arm and leads you and Mavis to a police car.

Narrator: Standing in Kohl's office, you see irritation in his eyes.
Kohl: {Danielle Name}, you should focus on reality, not indulge yourself in those fantasies.
Danielle: Sheriff Kohl, before you jump to any conclusions, I think you should listen to us.
Danielle: At least, it makes sense that's why the police ignored the crime!
Narrator: Kohl raises his eyebrows, confused.
Kohl: Well... did you guys really see the monster?
Narrator: You and Mavis exchange a look and turn to Sheriff Kohl.
Danielle: No... 
Danielle: But last time, I told you that I saw the person chasing Gavin...
Kohl: Yes, miss, but you had a drink. Your feelings couldn't be taken as evidence. 
Danielle: Now Mavis is saying that she saw his face clearly. 
Mavis: Yes, he was about 5'5''. And he had a beard.
Kohl: And?
Danielle: And Gavin looked terrified! He ran away from the crowd and disappeared!
Kohl: Well, all right. Let's just say that Gavin was being chased by someone. So what?
Mavis: So what? The man looked like a fugitive!
Kohl: Miss, you can't assume someone is a murderer just because he has a beard. 
Kohl: What you saw sounds like nothing to me.
Danielle(angry): ...
(ws_06n_01_police_station)
A. Why don't you believe me?
B. Then tell me, why are there so many coincidences?
A
Kohl: Because I'm a police officer, not an imaginative student.
Kohl(angry): Young girl, I've been a police officer for over two decades. 
Kohl(angry): I've seen a lot of suspicious people like you.
Kohl: If you had even the faintest idea of how the law worked...
Kohl: You would know that people are innocent until proven guilty. 
Danielle(angry): Fine, we can stop calling this man a murderer. But you have to investigate.
Danielle(angry): I'm not going to stop until you convince me that Gavin really did die in an accident.
Kohl(angry): {Danielle Name}, I know you've been through a lot. I'm sorry about that. 
Kohl(angry): But that doesn't mean I will allow you to mess around.
B
Kohl: Coincidences happen all the time. You girls have heard of probability, haven't you? 
Danielle: But the last time we talked, you said that the police rely on evidence, not probability.
Kohl: Both evidence and probability are reliable.
Danielle(angry): Sheriff Kohl, you can't fool me with that! Justice delayed is justice denied!
Danielle(angry): If you won't investigate, I'll do it for you.
Danielle(angry): I don't care what kind of chaos it'll cause.

Narrator: Kohl sighs, clearly exasperated.
Kohl: Well, then. We'll try to find this man and bring him in for questioning.
Kohl: Just to clear away your doubts, girls.
Kohl: But I have to remind you to stop spreading rumors before we've reached a conclusion. 
Kohl: Otherwise, I'll be forced to arrest you.
Danielle: But spreading rumors isn't a crime!
Kohl: That's not your call.
Kohl: All right, girls, you can go back to school.
Narrator: You try to say something else, but Mavis stops you. She looks terrified as she pulls you out into the hall.

Mavis(sad): Mom, please...
Narrator: Mavis tugs at her mother's sleeve, gesturing for her to stop.
Narrator: Her mother scowls at her, and Mavis lets go, rubbing her hands together uneasily.
Nicole(angry): Shut up, Mavis. You're embarrassing me. We'll talk after we get home.
Mavis(sad): ...Sorry, Mom.
Danielle(angry): Hey, don't talk to her like that! She's just trying to do the right thing!
Nicole(angry): Do the right thing? Just like Gavin? Don't give me that nonsense.
Nicole: Mavis, answer me. Do you want to end up dead in the Forbidden Forest, too?
Narrator: Mavis looks at you, and then pleadingly at her mother, but her mother just gives her a cold stare.
Narrator: Mavis speaks in an almost inaudible whisper, tears slipping from her cheeks.
Mavis(cry): ...No, Mother.

A. I never wanted to endanger Mavis.
B. But that wasn't why she snapped at me.

Wyatt: I know you didn't mean any harm. But your recklessness is dangerous.
Danielle(angry): I'm sorry Mavis got involved in this. But I can't forgive your wife for what she said.
Danielle(angry): And she seemed more concerned with belittling Mavis than protecting her.
Wyatt: You don't know her.
Danielle(sad): I know that Mavis is miserable! 
Danielle(angry): And I know that instead of comforting her, Nicole embarrassed her in front of all these people!  
B
Wyatt: Nicole's a tough cookie, but she didn't mean anything by what she said.
Danielle(angry): Even if she didn't mean to hurt me, she still hurt me!!
Wyatt: I know. But I also know that you're a good kid, and a forgiving one. Am I wrong?

Wyatt: Nicole has her own approach to parenting.
Wyatt: She believes she's helping Mavis grow up right.
Danielle(surprise): And you agree with her?
Wyatt: Nicole's a very persistent person.
Wyatt: She does what she thinks is right, and she doesn't let anyone stop her.
Narrator: Wyatt smiles bitterly, small and helpless.
Wyatt: What happened to your mom and your friend is terrible, and I'm sorry for that.
Wyatt: But being curious about the Forbidden Forest always ends in disaster.

Wyatt(smile): Listen, {Danielle Name}, I know that you've been through a lot lately. 
Wyatt(smile): Have you tried hot spring therapy?
Danielle(surprise): No...
Wyatt(smile): Our town's hot springs are famous for their restorative properties.
Wyatt(smile): If you're willing to try it, I could set up a free visit.
Danielle(surprise): What?
Wyatt(smile): You may not have noticed, but all the hot spring villas in this town have the same logo on them.

//4/2/1965\n Things haven't been going well.
//The day before yesterday, Tom started vomiting and his skin began flaking off. At first, he thought it was just a minor illness, so he didn't bother seeing a doctor. But when Tom and I were eating today, he suddenly started vomiting blood and chunks of flesh.
//We were both terrified. I wanted him to see a doctor, but Mr. William took Tom away and said he would take care of him. I worried about Tom all the afternoon. Another man I work with in the mine told me that a lot of the men have been getting sick recently.
//I started to notice it, too. There are a lot of fresh faces among the people who have come down to the mine in the past few days. I heard that they were transferred in from other places. Even still, we don't have enough men, and we need more.
//We had a lot of people, and good, strong workers, but the workload was just too much for them. In the end, a lot of the pressure fell on us, the last few healthy folks.
//Half an hour ago, William brought a group of people to inspect our work site. They were all wearing masks. Anybody who looked sick got taken away. Although William said that the company had asked a doctor to come take a look, there were rumors that everybody who's been "infected" has disappeared...
//I kept an eye out and realized that almost all of the sick men have been working in the mine since the 13th. Even worse, my itchy skin seems to be starting to fester. And my hair's growing faster and thicker than ever before. Growing in strange places, too. 
//I'm not sure what's going on, but there's definitely something wrong here. It seems like ever since we discovered that enormous stone, strange things have been happening. Maybe it's a curse, the work of the devil.
//I've used my mother's old home remedy to treat my skin, and I hope I feel better tomorrow.

Danielle(surprise): She can't control you like that! You need your own space.
Mavis(sad): I wish I had that. But I'm not allowed to disagree with her, ever.
Danielle(angry): That's ridiculous.
B
Mavis(sad): But she's my mom...
Danielle(angry): So what? She shouldn't hit you! 
Mavis(sad): It wouldn't be easy to report her. She practically owns this town.
Mavis(sad): I tried to report her once, but... my mom always gets what she wants.
***
Danielle(smile): Maybe you can talk to her?
Mavis(sad): She's not really the listening type.
Mavis(sad): All you can do is let her arrange everything for you and then obey her.
>>
Danielle(angry): You're a human being, not a doll!
Mavis(sad): I know my mom loves me, but the way she shows it is really hard to take sometimes.
Danielle(angry): You have to do something...
Mavis(sad): I really want to stand up to her, but I'm so scared of her... I really hate myself.

Mavis(sad): If I was like you, maybe things would be easier. You've always been so brave.

A. You can be like that, too.
B. You have us. We'll always have your back.
A
Danielle(sad): This is your life. Your mother can't make decisions for you.
Danielle(sad): You have to persist till you get what you want.
B
Danielle(smile): No matter what, we'll always be there for you.
Danielle(smile): Whenever you need us.

Mavis(sad): Do you think I'm weak?
Danielle(smile): Mavis, don't be so hard on yourself.
Danielle(smile): As long as you never compromise, you'll make it.
*Mavis LOVE +1
Mavis(smile): You're so kind. {Danielle Name}. That means a lot to me.
>>
Mavis(smile): Honestly, I'd rather be locked up than give you up.
Danielle(smile): Thank you for saying that. But Mavis, don't fight with your mom over me.
Danielle(sad): I don't want to get you in trouble.
Mavis(angry): But she won't let me talk to you!
Danielle(smile): We can go behind her back. I'm good at keeping secrets.
Narrator: Mavis lets out a deep sigh.
Mavis(sad): I'll work on standing up to my mom...about this and about everything else.
Mavis(smile): I'll ask her to get the police to investigate Gavin's case. Even it means I'll upset her!
Danielle(surprise): Are you sure? That's a risky move.
Mavis(sad): I know it is. But I also know my mom controls the economy of the entire town. 
Mavis(angry): She has a lot of influence. She can definitely get Sheriff Kohl to re-open Gavin's case.
Danielle(sad): Maybe she has her own problems.
Mavis(sad): I don't understand. Somebody died. What could be more important than life and death?
Danielle(smile): I don't get it either.
Danielle(smile): But I think it's better to figure it out by ourselves than to rely on others.
Narrator: Mavis lowers her voice and leans in close.
Mavis(happy): Are you guys doing your own investigation?
Danielle(happy): We want to figure out what exactly is inside the Forbidden Forest.
Mavis(surprise): Wow. That's totally off-limits! You guys are so brave!
Mavis(sad): I wish I could help, but I...
*Danielle NERVE +3
Danielle(smile): Don't worry, Mavis, you can help in other ways. Every bit of encouragement helps!
*Mavis NERVE +5
Mavis(happy): I'll do it! I'll keep an eye out! You guys can let me know if there's any way I can help!
Narrator: Mavis' phone rings. She glances down, but she doesn't pick up.
Mavis(sad): {Danielle Name}, it's my mom. I need to head back.
>
Danielle(smile): You should head on back.
Narrator: You see Mavis to the door and her figure disappears into the darkness of night.

Narrator: A few hours later, you hear the doorbell ring. It's the time Benjamin and Joe come and join you.
Joe(smile): When the night falls, we can sneak into the Forbidden Forest.
Benjamin(smile): I got a compass! flashlight  and GPS positioning! A must-have for secret agents!
Benjamin(smile): I also found a map in Gavin's stuff. That might help.
Narrator: Benjamin takes out the map. You notice it is marked with many strange symbols.

Danielle(surprise): What do these notes mean?
Benjamin: They're Gavin's. Strange things he found in the forest, maybe.
Benjamin(sad): I never knew he explored the Forbidden Forest on his own.
Narrator: Joe walks over to the couch, putting his hand on Ben's shoulder.
Joe(sad): Ben, I hate to say this, but you know what?
Joe: I think Gavin would be happy that we're starting our own investigation.
Danielle(smile): We're becoming braver and more positive. It's all because of Gavin.
Joe: He pushed us to be our best selves.
Benjamin: That's right. No matter what happens, he's been with us this whole time, in his own way.
Danielle(sad): Yeah. He wouldn't want to see us moping around all day.
Benjamin(sad): I know... it's just hard to take it all in at once... Okay, let's talk about our next step.
Danielle: If I can find that place, we can follow the trail of blood all the way into the Forbidden Forest.
Joe: As for weapons, I can grab my dad's shotgun in secret.
*Benjamin NERVE +2
Benjamin(smile): You gonna hunt rabbits while we're in there?
*Joe NERVE +2
Joe(happy): Well... maybe. But I was planning on hunting monsters.
Benjamin: I'll bring a baseball bat, then.

Danielle: I think I'll bring the...

Benjamin(smile): {Danielle Name}, you are very thoughtful.
>>
Joe(sad): Wait. There's one problem...
Joe(surprise): Why did Gavin expose himself immediately when he got close to the Forbidden Forest?
Danielle(surprise): You mean... someone has installed surveillance cameras around the Forbidden Forest?
Benjamin(angry): People in the whole town will become informants.
Danielle(surprise): Oh my God. This is horrible... How should we avoid them then?
Narrator: Joe strokes his chin thoughtfully.
Joe(smile): Maybe...we should prepare a suitable adventure outfit and wait until everyone is asleep.
Danielle(sad): But it's very late now. Where can we get a suitable adventure outfit?
Narrator: Joe hesitates for a while and takes out a package.
Joe(shy): You can wear this one if you don't mind...
Narrator: You open the package and find a sexy adventurer outfit inside.
Benjamin(happy): Wow, try it on. I can't wait to see {Danielle Name} turn into 007.
>
Danielle(smile): Ben, Joe, don't look!
Narrator: You turn away from the boys and go change in the bedroom
Narrator: When you go back to the living room in the adventure outfit, you feel the boys' eyes are alight with surprise.

Narrator: You turn to Joe. He averts your eyes, with his face blushing like a cooked shrimp.

Narrator: After a couple of minutes, you finally find it.
Danielle: It must be here. I saw this road sign at the police station. Let's go!
Narrator: You stand by the fence, shining your flashlight into the woods. The flashlight flickers dimly in the dark.
Benjamin: Now this is real horror.
Danielle: Shhh...
Narrator: Suddenly, you hear a hoarse chirp. You look up and see numerous glowing green eyes staring at you through the leaves!
Danielle(surprise): What the hell...
