Danielle(angry): They stabbed my mom and took her away...
Danielle(cry): We need to save her! She might be waiting for us to save her!
Narrator: Sheriff Kohl stares at you, clearly doubting that you're telling the truth.
Danielle(sad): Sheriff Kohl, I swear, what I said is true. I wouldn't joke about my mom's life.
B
Kohl: {Danielle Name}, that's not possible. It's very tough to clean up blood without leaving a trace.
Danielle(angry): Sheriff Kohl, I'm sure someone broke into our house and stabbed my mom!

Danielle(angry): My mom has gone missing!

Kohl: Maybe she went through something upsetting and tried to stay away for a while.
Kohl: I hate to say this, but the adult world is complicated.
Narrator: Kohl speaks to you with a tender tone.
Danielle(angry): No, I know my mom. She wouldn't do that!
Danielle(angry): You have to find her.
Kohl: Shh, kid, calm down.
Kohl: Since you're so insistent, we'll look into it, but it'll take some time.
Danielle(sad): Please make it quick, then. She is hurt.
Narrator: Sheriff Kohl sighs.

Kohl: All right, we'll take your word for it...for now, and look for Clare.
Kohl: I hope that we'll be able to get some answers after we find Clare.
Narrator: Kohl opens the door for you. Joe enters immediately and gives you a big hug.

Joe: {Danielle Name}, what did Kohl say?
Danielle(sad): They didn't believe me. But they said they'd look for Mom.
Narrator: Joe helps you sit down on the sofa. He goes to the kitchen and comes back a few moments later with a cup of hot tea.
Joe: {Danielle Name}, have some tea. It will make you feel better.
Danielle(sad): Joe...
Joe(surprise): What?
Danielle(sad): I don't understand. How did this happen?
Danielle(sad): We just moved here. We haven't made any enemies.
Narrator: You recall what happened last night, shivering.

Danielle(sad): If they didn't come for Mom, they came for me.
Joe(surprise): Why would you say that?
Danielle(sad): Is it all because of the Forbidden Forest? Did someone know I was investigating it?
Danielle(sad): You and Mom told me to never get involved with the Forbidden Forest.
Danielle(sad): But I didn't listen... Why didn't I?
Joe(sad): {Danielle Name}, even if it has something to do with the Forbidden Forest, it's not your fault.
Joe(sad): You shouldn't blame yourself.
Danielle(cry): I know, but I can't forgive myself. It should have been me... not my mom...
Narrator: You tremble as tears start flooding from your eyes. Joe gently holds you in his arms.
Narrator: You mutter to yourself, trembling. Never have you felt so helpless in your life.
Narrator: It's like you're drowning in the ocean and there are no lifeboats in sight.

Danielle(sad): Joe, I can't stop thinking. It's driving me nuts. Did they take my mom? What would they do to her?
Joe: {Danielle Name}, are you sure about what happened last night?

Narrator: You look closer and find someone else in the dark bush. You can't see his face.
Narrator: But it looks like he's pointing at the monster with a gun.
Benjamin(angry): Yes, it's a man.
Danielle: This man looks so calm. He's not afraid of the monster at all.
Benjamin: He must know this monster very well.
Danielle(surprise): ...

A. Or maybe he controls the monster.
B. Maybe he's the one who chased Gavin.
A
Danielle(surprise): I get the feeling that the monster is afraid of him.
Benjamin: Maybe this man tamed the monster. Just like in fairy tales.
Danielle(angry): That would explain why the monster never goes anywhere outside of the Forbidden Forest...
Danielle(angry): ...Because its owner doesn't let this thing break into the town. 
Benjamin(surprise): But why does he keep the monster around, then?
B
Danielle: The Forbidden Forest, the monster, the murder, and this man...
Danielle: There must be some connection between all of them.
Danielle: Maybe he saw Gavin was taking pictures and then started chasing Gavin.
Benjamin: Even if he didn't chase Gavin, he must have known something.
Danielle: It's a small town, after all. Illegal activities are always connected.
Benjamin: Now I think there might be another explanation for Gavin's death. 
Benjamin: Maybe he wasn't killed by the monster.
Benjamin: We have to find out the truth.

// “March 28th, 1965\ Dear Diary, it's been two weeks. Every day has been full of suffering.”
// “About 8 days ago, I received a telegram. It was from my mother. She told me Bonnie was sick. But she didn't want to go to the hospital because we were short of money. I was devastated...”
// “I remembered 10 years ago, when I proposed to her, I promised to make her the happiest woman in the world. But looking back, I've given her nothing but poverty and heavy housework. I couldn't even give her health.”
// “A week ago, I applied for the job in the No. 13 mine. Working there has been even more dangerous painful. But I thought everything was worth it to help my family, wasn't it?”
// “I thought the reason the No. 13 mine paid so much more was because it was dangerous. But today, I realized I was wrong. The real reason is that this mine is incredibly valuable.”
// “This morning, when I was working, I saw something. Even though it was covered in dust, I could see it glowing in the dim light. Mr. Williams drove us out. When I went by later that afternoon, the whole area was fenced off. There were even some police officers watching the place.”
// “I heard it was a huge diamond, worth more than I can even imagine. Apparently, it would take a lot of time and effort to mine it. How I wish I could own just a tiny piece!”
// “The living conditions in this damned place are terrible too. Since yesterday, my skin's been itching. I want to send mom a telegram, asking her for her old remedy for itching. And I want to tell Bonnie that my new job pays more than the last one. We don't need to worry about money anymore.”
// “How I miss them!”
Benjamin: What did you find?
Danielle: I don't know, exactly. But I think I'm one step closer to the truth.

Danielle(surprise): It's Mavis!
Narrator*Top: Mavis | We were told that Gavin died in an accident. 
Narrator*Top: Mavis | Well, in this town, everyone knows what "accident" means, right?
Narrator*Top: Mavis | It means the monster in the Forbidden Forest.
Benjamin(surprise): Oh my God! Mavis!
Danielle(surprise): She's so brave!

Narrator*Top: Mavis | Everyone in this town is afraid of the Forbidden Forest. 
Narrator*Top: Mavis | So every time a body is found in that place, the police will jump to call it “an accident”. 
Narrator*Top: Mavis | But have you ever thought... Why the police never catch the monster?!
Narrator*Top: Mavis | I've heard that the monster guards something in the Forbidden Forest.
Narrator*Top: Mavis | Is the police's doing nothing because they are in league with the monster?!
Narrator: You hear rapid footsteps from the staircase. You also hear the principal's voice.
Narrator*Top: Mavis | I have so many questions. I can't remained silent any more.
Narrator*Top: Mavis | So I'm choosing to unveil this, to force the police to stop ignoring this question!
Narrator*Top: Mavis | I want justice for Gavin!
Narrator*Top: Man's Voice | Nonsense! Get out!
