Narrator: Benjamin frowns with reluctance.
Danielle(surprise): What's wrong?
Benjamin(sad): Don't make fun of me, ok? But I always thought she was... a witch that likes to eat children!
>>
Danielle(surprise): What? Witch?!
Danielle(happy): But you said she's just an old lady.
Benjamin(sad): She's weird. I've been her neighbor for 17 years, but I've only seen her twice.
Benjamin(sad): Can you believe that?
Danielle(surprise): Maybe it's just because you don't have any common interests with her.
Danielle(surprise): She might be living on a different schedule than you.
Benjamin(sad): But all of my neighbors barely see her.
Benjamin(sad): Besides, at night I always hear horrible laughter coming from her house.
Benjamin(sad): Feels like a wicked witch is planning something horrible. Just like something you'd see on TV.
Narrator: Benjamin trembles like a leaf.
Danielle(smile): Maybe she's just watching a thriller.
Benjamin(sad): I don't know. But all the neighbors are afraid of her.
>>>
Benjamin(sad): There's more! I used to smell a strange scent of meat coming from her house.
Benjamin(sad): I've never smelled that kind of scent in my life.
Danielle(surprise): What was she cooking?
Benjamin(sad): Someone even told me she was cooking children or big rats and bats.
Benjamin(sad): My mom used to scare me when I wouldn't listen to her.
Benjamin(sad): She would say, <i>"Dr. Bentley loves to eat naughty children."</i>
Benjamin(sad): <i>"She laughs whenever she finds a new child to eat."</i>
>>
Danielle(smile): Sounds horrible. But look on the bright side, we're not children anymore.
Danielle(smile): She wouldn't be interested in eating us anyway.
Narrator: Benjamin frowns. He stares at the roof to avoid your eyes. You pat his arm, smiling.
>
Danielle(smile): Come on, Ben. We need to find out what happened to Dr. Bentley and James. You know this!
Narrator: You encourage Ben with a smile. He turns his head to avoid you, so you shift to stand in front of him.
Danielle(smile): Come on, Ben. Can you do this for me?
Benjamin(sad): ...Damn! It's really hard to say no to you!
Danielle(smile): So we have a deal?
Benjamin(sad): Tomorrow night. But you have to come with me. I'm not afraid. After all, it's just an evil witch.
Mavis(happy): Sounds exciting! Take me, please!
>>
Benjamin(sad): I don't think that's a good idea, Mavis.
Mavis(angry): What? Are you telling me I'm not good enough?
Benjamin(sad): Of course not. I'd never say that.
Mavis(angry): So tell me. Why not? You'd better give me a good reason, I'm very angry now.
Benjamin(smile): No offense, Mavis, you are brave . Well... most of the time.
Benjamin(smile): But when it comes to the Forbidden Forest and your mom, you become a wimp.
Mavis(sad): You're right. But I don't want to be like that anymore.
>
Benjamin(smile): Joe, what do you think?
Joe(smile): Well, Mavis, you need to think about it carefully. It's not like some kind of detective movie.
Benjamin(smile): What we're doing is really dangerous.
Joe(smile): If you're not determined enough and you leak this to anyone, we'll all be in trouble.
Narrator: Mavis stares at Benjamin and Joe in anger.

Mavis(angry): I'm not doing this for fun!
Danielle(smile): We need to give Mavis a chance.
Narrator: You put your hand around Mavis's shoulder and give it a tight squeeze.
Danielle(smile): Hey! Think of the newspapers! Mavis has already proven that she'd be a good partner.
Danielle(smile): Fighting against evil? I bet Mavis would be really good at that!

Benjamin(surprise): Do you really think so?
Danielle(smile): Yes! She's very brave.

Benjamin(sad): I heard witches like to eat children's arms. I don't want to lose my very buff and muscular arm.
Danielle(happy): Your arm is too hard to chew. The witch wouldn't like it.
Narrator: Benjamin stops and stares at you. He looks very serious.
Danielle(smile): What?
Benjamin(smile): I can come with you. But we need to be prepared to run for it if things go south.

Danielle(surprise): Seriously? 
Benjamin(smile): Of course! Let me show you something!
Danielle(smile): What is it?
Benjamin(smile): If we're going to fight against an evil witch, we'll need weapons!

Danielle(happy): Hey, is this a seagull? Why does it look so unhappy?
Benjamin(happy): Because it doesn't have one of these.
Narrator: Benjamin picks up another coin. You take a closer look and notice a fish on it.
Danielle(surprise): There are so many peculiar coins here. Where did they come from?

Benjamin(happy): These all belong to my friend, Jerry.

Benjamin(smile): A thousand years ago, a very famous doctor drew inspiration from animals and invented it.
Benjamin(smile): It's Chinese martial arts.
Narrator: Benjamin tries to imitate the images from the scroll and perform them for you, but he can barely balance his body.

B. You look like a fool!

Benjamin(happy): What's more, you might become immortal.
Danielle(surprise): Wow! That's wonderful! I wish I could master it!
Danielle(sad): But it's beyond my understanding.

Benjamin(happy): Maybe I'll be a kung-fu master one day. Like Bruce Lee.
Narrator: Benjamin stands on one leg. He slips and falls down. You come over to help him back up, laughing.
Danielle(happy): Well, try not to get hurt.
Benjamin: All right. Maybe I'm not designed for this.

Narrator: You keep walking until you reach another shelf. There're a lot of small items on it.
Narrator: You come closer and notice something red. It looks like a gun.
Danielle(surprise): There's a gun!
Benjamin(happy): It's not an ordinary gun. Take a shot.
Narrator: Benjamin picks up the gun and puts it in your hand. To your surprise, big as it is, it's not heavy at all.
Narrator: Benjamin gestures for you to fire. You shoot up at the roof. It lets out a strange sound.

//"Just an hour ago, I went to the outhouse. It's always dark there, so I took a lamp. I heard something when I arrived. It was like someone or something was chewing a bone.",
//"At first, I thought it was Jason. This lad loved to chew chicken bones. But he would hide when he was doing it, because other people would laugh at him. I thought it was him and I was trying to play a trick on him. I yelled \"Oh, Jason, is that you? Why are you eating in the outhouse?\"",
//"I was just planning to play a trick on Jason. But other people heard me. More and more people ran over to watch the show.",
//"Suddenly the chewing stopped. But we couldn't see any trace of him. A young lad lost his patience. He yelled \" I gotta drive this guy out\" and went into the outhouse."
//"Just a minute after he went inside, he started screaming. He rushed out in fear, and screamed \"Monster! There's a monster inside! It's eating someone!\"",
//"Then we saw the thing. The red-eyed monster. It looked like a man, a madman. It followed the lad and rushed out. When the thing saw us, it attacked us. It was trying to bite us, like a mad dog. Everyone was frightened. We fought with it, and finally, we tied it up with rope.",
//"I went back to the dorm and thought everything was over. But just now, I heard that thing was found dead. Someone found it rotten and dead!",
//"Although Mr. William warned us not to speak, still, I heard something. Recently, there have been more and more mad people like what I just saw. Most of them are the same people who got sick. The rest of them were locked up.",
//"Now I'm extremely nervous. Although I've recovered from the rotten skin, I'm beginning to grow thick hair, like bristles. They had spread to my neck. What is going on?",
//"Oh God! Please save me! Please save your lamb!"

Letter This was my first working month in Spring Paradise. The company had sent over a patient named James.\n \n His chest was impaled and his ribs were broken. My first instinct was to stabilize him.
Letter But it was a very difficult procedure. 10 days later, James woke up from a coma and insisted on leaving without further treatment...\n \n I thought he was just being irrational and advised him to continue the treatment.
Letter Only later did I realized why he insisted on leaving... \n \n Someone switched his final prescription and threatened they'd send me to Hell with him if I continued helping him.
Letter I was afraid and angry. I reported it to the company but no help came.\n \n Ultimately, I realized they didn't want me to heal him. They just wanted to test the new drug on him.
Letter James told me he discovered a secret and decided not to drag me into it. I was the only one to see him off.\n \n He told me he won't go far and that he'll probably head to...

Danielle(surprise): The rest is blotted out!
Benjamin(surprise): Did the witch think someone might read the notes?
Narrator: You frown.
Benjamin(smile): Maybe we should take this page as evidence...
Narrator: Benjamin tears out the page and put it in your pocket.

Narrator: Suddenly you hear a strange noise...
Narrator: You feel something cold pressing against your back, sending chills up your spine!
Etam(angry): That's far enough. Turn around, slowly.

Narrator: You turn around and see Dr. Bentley pointing a hunting rifle at you. Her hands are trembling with anger!

Benjamin(surprise): Oh my God!

Etam(angry): Damn you, you brought the evil spirit in here! Why wouldn't you leave me alone?
Danielle(surprise): ...
(ws_10_10_the_evil)
A. Evil spirit?
B. Take it easy, let's calm down.
C. You look like an evil spirit to me.
A
Danielle(surprise): What are you talking about?
Narrator: Dr. Bentley has a scared look in her eyes and quickly checks outside the window.
Etam(angry): Was I not clear? You brought the evil spirit, now go out this way, quickly!
B
Danielle(smile): We didn't mean any harm.
Etam(angry): You're trespassing private property and you want me to take it easy?
Etam(angry): If you don't have a good reason, you better leave now before I shoot!
C
Benjamin(surprise): {Danielle Name}!
Narrator: Benjamin frowns and tugs at you.
Danielle(angry): Was I wrong? Why would a normal person turn her home into a haunted house?
Benjamin(sad): Don't shoot! I swear I love this place, it's fantastic!
Etam(angry): Shut up and leave!

Danielle(sad): I'm sorry, but...
Narrator: You take a step toward Dr. Bentley and feel her getting tense...
Etam(angry): I'm warning you, not another step!
Danielle(sad): They said mom ran into the Forbidden Forest to find out what happened to my grandfather and uncle...
Danielle(sad): I'll lose the only family I have left if I don't do something.
>>
Danielle(sad): Dr. Bentley, you've helped Mr. James, why can't you help me?
Narrator: You're staring at Dr. Bentley with a gun between you.
Narrator: Cold sweat starts dripping down your forehead and you dig your nails into your palm.
Narrator: After what seems like an eternity, Dr. Bentley lowers the gun and lets out a sigh.
Etam(sad): I won't make this any harder than it needs to be. You are free to go.
Danielle(surprise): But...
>
Etam(sad): I promised James I'd keep it a secret forever.
Etam(sad): So please don't make it hard for me either.
Narrator: As you try and say something else, Benjamin grabs your arms and drags you toward the door.
Narrator: You feel Dr. Bentley slip something into your hand as you walk past her...
*Scene FOREST_TRAIL_DUCK (Time: 2.5)
Benjamin(sad): That Dr. Bentley is so uncool. We can't expect anything from of her now...
Narrator: As you pass by a dark eucalyptus grove, Benjamin shakes his fists.
Narrator: You fiddle with the note in your pocket and ponder...
Danielle(smile): What if... she had a reason?
Benjamin(surprise): Reason?! What reason?
Narrator: You unfold the wrinkled note as Benjamin leans over, confused.
Benjamin(smile): <i>7am Sunday, I'll leave the backdoor open...</i>
Benjamin(smile): <i>The password is <color=olive>"The brat next door."</color> –Dr. Bentley.</i>
Benjamin(surprise): Wait, that would mean...
Danielle(smile): She wanted us to sneak up on her.
Benjamin(surprise): But why?

Narrator: As you're about to answer, a sudden gust of wind rips the paper from your hand and whisks it into the woods.
Narrator: Startled, you turn around only to see a shadowy figure standing between you and Ben...
