Innkeeper(smile): We'll see about that. This room is said to bring people together. I call it the love nest.

Narrator: Matt looks at the innkeeper in disbelief. Not the slightest trace of amusement to be found in his face.
Matt(sad): Sigh. Okay. Fine. Wifi?
Innkeeper(happy): Wife? No, I'm single and have been for twenty years. Why? Are you interested in senior ladies?
Matt(confuse): ...
Narrator: Matt looks at you, his eyes pleading you to take over before he loses his mind.
Narrator: You suppress a laugh but can't hide the broad grin that stretches across your face...
Narrator: ... Making Matt quirk an eyebrow at you disapprovingly.
Rosie(happy): I think Mr. Dalton meant to ask if you have a computer we can use with an internet connection?
Rosie(smile): We have an important Skype meeting later, but we don't have a signal on our phones.
Innkeeper(sad): Oh, no. I don't use that, and I know no one who does.
Innkeeper: Most people in Whitepine are elderly, so I'm not sure which direction to point you in. I'm sorry.
Rosie(smile): It's okay. Uhm... Is there a place to eat nearby?
Innkeeper(smile): We have a lovely diner just down the street. You should try their stuffed hash browns.

Matt: So, we definitely need to get you something to eat.

Rosie: Mr. Dalton, if you need us to go out and find WiFi somewhere if it's even possible, then let's do it.
Rosie(sad): But if not, then please let it go, and let's eat. I'm afraid you're only stressing yourself out this way.
Matt: A man in my position isn't expected to "let things go." I'm expected to fix things.
Rosie: I know, but that would require you fixing the plane. Can you do that?
Matt(sad): Obviously not.
Rosie(smile): Then you can't fix things, and it's okay, it's not your fault.

Narrator: He smiles softly, choosing not to respond but extends an arm, gesturing you to go first.

Rosie(happy): Me cold? I showered you in snow, basically gave you an ice bath. You must be cold.
Matt(confuse): What?! Was being pinned up against the tree, delivering the final blow, too subtle for you? 
Narrator: You roll your eyes.
Rosie(smile): Just because you fired the last bullet doesn't mean you won the battle.
Matt(smile): Well, if that's the case, then maybe...
Narrator: Matt bends down, about to scoop up more snow.
Rosie(happy): No, please. Fine, you won, okay? Happy now?
Matt(smile): I always win.
Rosie(confuse): Pfft... I'll get you next time.

Rosie(smile)*Think: Of course, I already knew...
Rosie(smile)*Think: ...But he finally confirmed it, which means I can use it to get closer to him.
Rosie(surprise): Ashley? Ashley Silverstein? Are you...?
Narrator: Matt sighs, not looking at you.
Matt: Ashley and I are, I guess, exploring becoming a thing, yes.
Rosie: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry.
Matt(smile): You're not, it's okay. I let it slip, so it's my fault.
Narrator: Matt kneads his shoulder as if the mere thought of marrying Ashley is making his body tense.
Rosie(smile): I guess that explains why she seems so attached to you.
Matt: She's great and smart and beautiful, but she can be a bit intimidating. Don't let it scare you.

Rosie(smile): Ashley would probably not like this very much.
Matt: Nope. But as long as she doesn't know, she won't try and intimidate you into quitting.

Matt(smile): Uh-huh, right. I think there's a bit of truth in that statement.

Matt(smile): Okay, I'll make a note of that then.

Matt(smile): So, uh... we should probably get ready for bed. Do you want to use the bathroom first or?
Rosie(smile): You do that. I'll change into Pjs here. Just give me two minutes, at least, okay?

Narrator: Matt leaves the room while you fish your Pjs up from your bag and get changed.

Narrator: When you return, you see Matt has prepared a bed for himself on the floor in front of the fireplace...
Narrator: ... Using the bed cover as a mattress.
Rosie*Think: Matt is still adamant about sleeping on the cold floor.
Rosie(smile)*Think: I think it would give our relationship a boost...

Rosie(smile): Risk what?
Narrator: Matt chews on his lower lip for a few seconds.
Rosie(confuse)*Think: Fabricating a lie now, are we?
Matt(confuse): I... I can't risk Ashley finding out.
Rosie(smile)*Think: I thought so. A lie.
Rosie(smile): Alright. I'll respect your wish. Just know that I would never tell anyone.

Narrator: The tossing and turning are then replaced by him quietly cursing to himself. You sit up in the bed.
Rosie: Cold?
Narrator: Matt sighs, rubbing his arms.
Matt(sad): I wasn't at first, but now...
Rosie(smile): Alright. Time to switch places. I'll sleep on the floor for a while. You take the bed.
Matt(surprise): What? No! Absolutely not.
Rosie(confuse): Well, since you refuse to sleep in the same bed as me...
Rosie(smile): And since I won't be able to sleep because of your teeth clattering...
Rosie(smile): I suggest we take turns sleeping in the bed. It's only fair.

Rosie(sad): Why? It's not fair that you're freezing either.
Matt: Not a chance.

Matt(smile): Anyway, given my single-life habits...
Matt(sad): I don't trust myself so much. Yet. So, I can't let myself get tempted.
Rosie(smile)*Think: So, Matt just admitted he might get carried away if we were to share a bed.
Rosie*Think: But "might" is not enough for me.
Rosie(sad)*Think: Because there's still so much doubt about us, I can't risk him backing out last minute.
