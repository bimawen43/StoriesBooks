Narrator: Two men dressed in suits open the large glass doors for you to enter the ballroom. You smile at them humbly.
Narrator: Once inside, you realize you're at the top of a large marble staircase, looking over the dining room and the dance floor and all its guests.
Narrator: And like when Cinderella entered the ball, everyone turns to look at who's coming down the stairs next.
Rosie(surprise)*Think: Frigg, they're all looking at me.
Narrator: You move your way down the stairs quickly, slightly uncomfortable having all these eyes follow you.
Narrator: You move across the floor to greet Mr. Silverstein and Matt, and naturally, Ashley, who's holding Matt's arm.

B
Silverstein(happy): Ms. Winter, good to see you. What a nice dress you're wearing.
Ashley(confuse): Got a little too much to drink already, Daddy?

Narrator: Ashley snarls before looking at you with nothing but disgust in her eyes, but Mr. Silverstein doesn't listen.
Silverstein(smile): You're a natural beauty, you don't need a fancy gown, does she, Mr. Dalton?

Narrator: It's obvious to you that Mr. Silverstein is trying to test Matt himself.
Ashley(angry): Ahem!
Narrator: But fortunately, Ashley interrupts him for attention.
Silverstein(smile): Yes, yes, you too, my little hummingbird.
Narrator: But it's not enough.

Silverstein(smile): How do you manage to work when an enchantress like her is around?
Rosie(sad)*Think: Oh, be quiet, you fool!

Rosie(sad)*Think: Oh, my God, I'm completely blank! Think, {Rosie Name}!
Narrator: But nothing comes to mind. Matt looks at you, and for a moment, it's as if he knows everything.
Message: Be careful | Matt is now suspicious and highly uncomfortable.
>>>
Matt(angry): Ms. Winter is a beautiful woman, Mr. Silverstein, <i>no doubt about that</i>.
Matt: But I'm always professional.
> 
Narrator: Matt is visibly very uncomfortable, and to your dismay, you notice him pulling Ashley closer...
Narrator: ... As if he feels the need to prove he's standing by his end of the deal, that he's loyal.
Silverstein(sad): Hm. I should probably invite everyone to take a seat. The food will be ready shortly.
Narrator: Mr. Silverstein glances skeptically at Matt one last time before he leaves you.
Rosie(sad)*Think: Oh, crap. Now Matt's probably not going to relax around me all night...

Rosie: Just in time to make your Winter Formal even more festive, huh, Mr. Silverstein?
Silverstein(smile): What? Oh, yes, yes.
Silverstein: That reminds me, I should probably invite everyone to take a seat. The food will be ready shortly.

Message: Good job | You took control of the conversation.
Rosie(smile)*Think: Phew. That was close, but I think that did the trick.

Rosie(happy): It's such a beautiful house you've got, Mr. Silverstein. I've never seen anything like it before.
Rosie(smile): Did you have it renovated, or was it like this when you bought it?
Silverstein(smile): What? Oh, I had it renovated. Everything is new.
Rosie(smile): You've got great taste. And the table decorations are beautiful.
Silverstein(smile): Thank you. 
Silverstein: That reminds me, I should probably invite everyone to take a seat. The food will be ready shortly.

Silverstein(happy): Please move to the dining hall and take a seat. The entre will be served shortly.

Narrator: Everyone does as he says. You see Matt sit down next to Mr. Silverstein, and then a couple sits down apposite Matt and Mr. Silverstein.
Narrator: You and Ashley share a look as you both realize...

Rosie(surprise)*Think: There's only one spot left next to Matt!

Rosie(angry)*Think: Since there are no place cards, this seat might as well be mine.
Narrator: Ashley grabs the chair next to Matt and pulls it out.
Rosie(happy): Why thank you, Ashley!
Ashley(surprise): Hey!
Narrator: You sit down in the chair. Neither Matt nor Mr. Silverstein saw anything. You're safe.
Ashley(angry): Hell no! That's {*Attention MY} seat!
>>R
Rosie: I'm sorry, I don't see your name anywhere?
>R
Ashley(angry): Daddy! She took my seat!
Silverstein(sad): ...
Narrator: Mr. Silverstein looks at you, and you fear he'll tell you to get up from the chair and leave it to Ashley. That would be so embarrassing.
Narrator: But then he smiles at you. You just proved to him you're willing to play dirty.
Silverstein(smile): Ashley, these are our guests.
Silverstein: Be a good hostess and take the seat next to Ms. Winter instead.
Silverstein: After all, she doesn't know anyone but Mr. Dalton. You do.
Narrator: Ashley's expression hardened. She crossed her arms, and her lips drew back in a snarl.
Ashley(angry): Fine.

Rosie(smile)*Think: Not my proudest move, but Mr. Silverstein told me to do what I have to do to sleep with Matt.

Narrator: You step aside, letting Ashley claim the seat, and she does, like a hawk catching a mouse.
Narrator: You sit down next to her. It's easy to tell she's not interested in talking to you, as she turns her chair away from you to face Matt.
Rosie(sad)*Think: Matt's really the only person I can talk to, but she's blocking me from doing so.
Rosie*Think: I guess it'll be a quiet dinner for me.
Narrator: And just as predicted, you barely get to say a word to Matt throughout the entire dinner.

Rosie(surprise): Oh?
Narrator: You open the door and are immediately met by Matt's dark brown eyes, trying to read your face.

Rosie(smile): I suppose you saw me leaving?
Matt(smile): Yeah. I just wanted to check if everything is okay? Can I come in?
Rosie(shy): Sure. Come in.

Narrator: You step aside, and Matt strolls inside, looking around your room.
Matt(sad): So? Are you okay?
Rosie*Think: How do I reply?
(htcac_09_14_matts_care)
A. No, I don't fit in.
B. Yes, it's all just new to me.
A
Rosie(sad): Honestly, no. I don't fit in here. I feel like such an outsider.
Matt(smile): And so what if you don't fit in? You don't have to. It was never part of the job description.
Rosie(shy): Right...
Matt(shy): And, to be honest, you're kind of the only person in this house I can stand right now.
B
Rosie(smile): I guess. It's all just very new to me. I feel a bit overwhelmed.
Matt(smile): Understandable, but you're not heading to bed already, are you?
Matt(shy): Because you're kind of the only person in this house, I can stand right now.
***
Rosie(confuse): Really? And what about Ashley?
Matt(sad): Of course, I can stand Ashley and Mr. Silverstein, but all they talk about are... superficial things.
Matt: Conversations with them are just dull and empty. It's not like that with you.
Rosie(shy)*Think: Aw...
Narrator: Matt takes a step closer to you, lifting his hands.

Matt: {Rosie Name}, there's something I want to tell you.
*Condition
A. (Condition: TIME_FAIL_9 >= 1)
A
Matt(confuse): And I know I said I'm always professional earlier, but I just have to be personal right now.
***
Matt: The more I get to know you, the more I feel the need to be <b>completely honest</b> with you.
Rosie(surprise)*Think: Is this it? Is he finally going to tell me about his deal with Mr. Silverstein?
Narrator: Matt sighs, then lifts his chin.
Matt(sad): I'm not marrying Ashley out of love. I made a deal with Mr. Silverstein.
Matt: He's promised to make me CEO of Silverstein Corp. if I marry Ashley.
Rosie(sad): Matt...
Matt(sad): I know what you're thinking...
Matt(sad): <i>"What kind of man would throw away his personal life, the chance of finding true love for a job?"</i>
Rosie(sad): Well, kinda, but in a less judgemental way. I just wonder why it's necessary?
Rosie: I mean, you're COO, aren't you naturally "next in line"?
Matt(sad): I don't know. I would think so, but when Mr. Silverstein made me the offer...
>>>
Matt: He made sure to let me know that <b>he's considering other guys</b> in Silverstein Corp.
>>
Matt(sad): Some have more experience than me; others have better contacts or are closer to Mr. Silverstein.
Rosie(angry): So, he basically told you marrying Ashley is the only way you'd be offered this position?
Matt(sad): I guess he did.
Rosie(sad): That's...
(htcac_09_15_matt_tell_the_ture)
A. Clever.
B. Manipulative.
A
Rosie(confuse): Clever, unfair, but still a clever way to get Ashley what she wants, too, that spoiled brat.
B
Rosie(confuse): Manipulative as hell. He'll give Ashley whatever she wants, that spoiled brat.
***
Matt(confuse): It is. And Mr. Silverstein knows how much I want it. How hard I've worked.
Matt(sad): It would kill me to see him give the position to someone else when I'm the COO. It should be me.
Matt(sad): So, I took the deal.
>>>
Rosie(sad): W-Why did you feel the need to tell me this, Matt?
>>
Matt(sad): Because there's more.
Matt(sad): Mr. Silverstein had me promise to prove myself worthy of Silverstein Corp. and Ashley.
Matt: He's basically told me to stop partying and stop dating, but...
Rosie(sad): Yes...?
>>>
Matt(sad): But then <b>I met you</b>.
Matt: The day I made a deal with him was the night I met you. That's why I was at "Lou's Bar" and drinking.
>>
Matt(sad): I was kind of "mourning" the death of my love life. It sounds stupid, but it is what it is.
Rosie(surprise)*Think: I can't believe he's admitting to all of this, being so vulnerable with me.
Rosie(sad)*Think: Is he going to admit he's got feelings for me too?
Rosie(sad): It doesn't sound stupid at all. I would've done the same.
Rosie(sad)*Think: I was actually doing the same thing, mourning the death of love and my expectations of it.
Matt(sad): The reason I'm telling you this is because you're somehow <b>making me second guess this deal</b>.
Rosie(smile): How?
Matt(smile): Well, you've been reminding me that there are other things to life than work.
>
Narrator: You can hear the music playing downstairs. It's a nice, slow song.
Narrator: Matt takes yet another step closer to you, extending his hand...
Matt(smile): You've been reminding me to have a little fun sometimes...
Rosie(happy): Are you asking me to dance, Mr. Dalton?
Matt(smile): Yes, I believe I kinda promised you one. What do you say? Wanna live a little, Ms. Winter?
Rosie(smile)*Think: How do I respond to his invitation?
(htcac_09_16_dance_invite)
A. Just take his hand.
B. Absolutely.
C. Hesitate.
A
Rosie(shy): ...
Narrator: You give him a tender smile as you place your hand in his.
B 
Rosie(happy): I'd love to, Mr. Dalton.
C
Narrator: You hesitate for a moment.
Matt(happy): I'm finally trying to have some fun, and now you're considering rejecting me?
Rosie(happy): No, no... It's just... I mean, I'm just surprised. That's all.
Narrator: You finally put your hand in his, and he closes it gently.

Narrator: He pulls you closer, putting his other hand softly on the small of your back.
Narrator: You put your hand on his shoulder. The fabric of his suit feels soft on your skin.
Narrator: His cologne tingles your senses, and as you feel him looking down at you...
Narrator: ... The hairs on the back of your neck stand up like flowers in the morning sun.
*Camera Middle 2

Narrator: His eyes shift from your eyes to your lips as if he's accessing whether or not you want this.
