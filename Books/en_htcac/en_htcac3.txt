Narrator: When lunch arrives, you and Matt make your way down the street to a fancy restaurant.
Narrator: Dark wood and grays dominate the color palette, but a few vases with big, fragrant flowers provide a splash of color.
Matt: Okay, so, Silverstein Corp. is hosting a charity gala each year.
Matt(smile): Each year, we support a different cause, too, based on what our employees vote for.
Rosie(surprise): Wait, you let all of your employees vote?
Matt: Yes. Earlier this year, we had everyone who had a cause they wanted to nominate, submit it.
Matt: The cause that won this year is probably no surprise; the climate.
Matt(smile): And we will be donating the money raised on Saturday to a research organization-
Matt(smile): That researches solutions to sustain our natural resources.
Rosie(smile): That's amazing.
Matt: Thank you. Let's order some food and get to work. What would you like?
Narrator: You look at the menu, it's all gourmet.
Rosie(surprise): Wow.
Matt: What?
Rosie(shy): It's purely gourmet, huh?
>>>
Matt: If you're worried about the price, then don't. It's on me.
>
Rosie(smile): Thank you, Mr. Dalton. I've only tried gourmet food a few times before...

B. I'd rather have a cheeseburger.

Narrator: Matt seems surprised by your honesty.

Matt(smile): There's that bluntness again.
Rosie(confuse): It's not personal.
Matt(smile): Well, I'll remember your preference.
Matt(smile): Honestly, though, they make a killer gourmet cheeseburger here too.
Rosie(happy): I guess I'll try that then.

Narrator: Matt orders your food while you grab your tablet up from your bag.
Rosie(smile): Okay, I'm ready to take notes.
Matt: Good. The nonprofit organization works in over 50 countries to address the topics of climate-
Matt: Food, water, energy, cities, transport, and forests. Did you get that?
Rosie(sad): Not all of it. Can you repeat it and maybe slow down a bit?
Matt(angry): Ms. Winter, you need to keep up, I don't have time to repeat myself all the time.
Rosie(angry)*Think: He's so impatient. What should I use to respond?
(htcac_03_08_respond_matt)

Rosie(angry): Well, if time is what you're worried about then let me tell you that you would save more time-
Rosie(angry): If you had just repeated what I asked you to instead of scolding me and starting an argument.
Matt(confuse): I am your boss, Ms. Winter, I have the right to expect more from you.
***
Rosie(angry): No wonder your other assistant quit.
>
Narrator: You mutter under your breath as your food arrives. When the waiter has left, Matt sighs.
Matt: She didn't quit. I fired her.
Rosie(angry): Why? For asking you to repeat what you said?
Matt: No...
Matt(confuse): Because she distracted me. It was too unprofessional.
Rosie(surprise): Oh...
Rosie(sad): If that's the case... Then why didn't you fire me when you saw me?

B

Rosie(sad): I mean, we didn't do anything, and I went home alone, but... we had a spark, right?
Rosie: That wasn't exactly professional either.
***
Matt: No. But you didn't know who I was, and I wasn't your boss at the time either.
Matt: It wouldn't have been fair to fire you before you got a chance to prove you could be professional.
Rosie(sad): Right. 
Rosie(sad)*Think: Guess I'm screwed then... I can't win his heart by only being professional.
Matt(confuse): And for the record, I wouldn't fire anyone for asking me to repeat myself.
Matt: But that doesn't mean I won't expect you to work faster and push you.
Matt: If you can't handle that, then maybe this isn't the job for you, Ms. Winter.
Rosie(sad)*Think: What should I say? I need this job.
(htcac_03_09_work_faster)
A. I can handle it.
B. I'll work faster.

Matt(smile): Good, then let's continue where we left off.
Narrator: You nod. The rest of the lunch goes by smoothly.

*Scene INT_SILVERSTEIN_CAFETERIA_DAY (Color: Black 3)
Narrator: Later that day, you and Brisa go to your coffee break together.
Rosie(sad): I never thought working for Matt would be so hard...
Rosie(sad): Or, it's not hard, as per se, but he's so hard to please.
>>>
Brisa(smile): What did you expect? He's a guy, and a guy in one of the big, leather chairs at that.
>
Rosie(smile): True, but we have a bit of history. I guess I just thought he'd be friendlier than this.
Rosie(sad): Lunch was pretty awkward. He kept telling me to write faster and to stop asking so many questions.
Brisa(sad): I'm sorry, {Rosie Name}, that sounds rough.
Rosie(sad): Not gonna lie, it was a bit disheartening. I felt like such a disappointment.
Brisa(smile): I know what you mean. I did too when I first started working here.
Rosie(sad): Was Matt the one getting you accustomed to everything too?
Brisa(sad): Worse... It was the secretary before me. Mr. Silverstein had just fired her.
>>>
Rosie(surprise): What? So he had her train her replacement?
>>
Brisa(sad): Yes. It was horrible. She kept bursting into tears.
Brisa(sad): So, not only did I struggle to understand what she was trying to teach me...
Brisa(sad): I also felt like I was "robbing" her of her job.
Rosie(sad): It was not your fault. I hope you know that now.
Brisa(sad): Thanks. I do, but at the time, I felt really out of place.
Brisa(sad): And I understood her disappointment.
Brisa(sad): It might not be the most significant achievement to be a secretary...
Brisa(smile): But it's kind of a big deal...
Brisa(smile): ... If you get a job as a secretary for a CEO in one of the biggest firms in New York.
>
Rosie(smile): Of course, it's a big deal.
Rosie(sad): Poor girl, that must've been...
(htcac_03_10_the_secretary)
A. Torturous.
B. Humiliating.
A
Rosie(confuse): Torturous, having it rubbed in your face like that. I hope he compensated her greatly for it.
B
Rosie(sad): Humiliating as hell. I hope he compensated her greatly for it.
***
Brisa(sad): Me too.
Rosie(sad): I guess this industry can be ruthless sometimes, huh?
Brisa(smile): Yeah, but it helps to have friends around. I'm really glad I met you, {Rosie Name}.
Rosie(shy): Aw, you too, Brisa. It's nice to have someone to vent to so things don't blow up.
>>>
Brisa(smile): Exactly. Anyway, we should probably head back, but we'll see each other tonight, right?
Rosie(happy): Of course. Our girl's night. I'll be there.
>
Brisa(happy): Good.
Narrator: You feel better, and lighter, after talking to Brisa about today's lunch.
