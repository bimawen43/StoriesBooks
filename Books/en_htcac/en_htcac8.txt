Silverstein(smile): And I know you've got things to do so I'll make it short.
Silverstein(happy): I'd like to invite you both to my annual Winter Formal at my house in The Hamptons this Saturday.
Silverstein(smile): I know it might be with a bit of a short notice, but, to be honest, I completely forgot it was this weekend.

Matt(smile): Thank you very much, sir. It's an honor.

Rosie(smile): A Winter Formal, huh? You've done this before, right?
Matt(smile): Not really, actually. I think this might be because Mr. Silverstein is considering making me the next CEO.
Rosie*Think: I wonder when he'll tell me the truth...
Rosie*Think: ... That he is in fact set to be the next CEO if he marries Ashley.
Rosie*Think: Let me probe him a little.

Rosie(smile): Why would he invite me then? I'm just your assistant.
Matt(smile): Maybe he wants us to talk business and thinks I'll need you there?
Matt(happy): Or maybe he just likes you? That wouldn't surprise me.

Narrator: An ominous-sounding rumble roars through the streets of New York City. The sky, that was clear and blue before, has started to darken.
Rosie(surprise): Wow, it suddenly started to pour, huh? We barely made it inside.
Matt: Yeah, I hate to admit it, but I prefer the snow over rain too.
Rosie(smile): Probably won't be long before it reaches New York.
Matt(smile): No, and speaking of snow... How was the rest of your weekend in Franklin?
Rosie(smile): It was great. My mom and I spent a lot of time...

A. Cleaning.
B. Playing cards.
C. Watching Christmas movies.
A
Rosie(smile): ... Cleaning.
Matt(smile): Yeah, that does sound... great.
Narrator: Matt teases, taking a sip of his water.
Rosie(happy): Believe it or not, but cleaning and decluttering is really relaxing for me.
Rosie(smile): And mom can't do much herself these days.
Matt(smile): Right, she's sick. You mentioned that.
Rosie(sad): Yeah... And since my dad isn't around to help anymore...
Matt: I get it. It's kind of the same with my Grandpa these days.
Rosie(smile): He's lucky to have you.
Matt(smile): Thank you, {Rosie Name}. And so is your mother to have you.
B
Rosie(smile): ... Playing cards.
Matt(smile): That sounds relaxing.
Rosie(happy): It was. We used to play a lot when my dad was alive.
C
Rosie(smile): ... Watching Christmas movies. Netflix has got a ton out already.
Matt(smile): I've noticed. I've heard they're very cheesy, though.
Rosie(happy): They are. But Christmas movies are kind of our thing. 
Rosie(smile): We always made plans to watch them together when I was a kid...
Rosie(smile): But it always ended up just being mom and me watching them. 
Rosie(happy): Dad would always fall asleep on the couch.

Narrator: Matt pulls the golden coin he fiddled with in Whitepine up from his pocket.
Matt(shy): Your dad gave me this the day I helped him paint the chicken coop. He told me it was rare.
Rosie(surprise): He did?
Matt(smile): Here...
Narrator: Matt hands you the coin. It's warm from being in Matt's hand.
Matt: Your dad inspired me to start collecting coins. He told me about his own collection too.
Matt(smile): That combined with some wise words about working hard to get where you want to be in life...
Matt(smile): ... Actually plays a big part in us being here right now and me being where I am in my career.
Matt: I didn't know your dad very well, unfortunately, but that day, he taught me so much about hard work.
Matt(sad): He was a great man. I wish I could've thanked him.
Rosie(sad): Are you being serious right now?
Matt: Of course! I would never lie about this.
Narrator: You feel a lump the size of a lemon forming in your throat, and tears start to press on.
Narrator: But they're not the sad kind, they are the happy, proud ones. You give the coin back to Matt.
Rosie(shy): Thank you for telling me that. I'm not surprised that he'd do that. He was an amazing dad.

Matt(smile): He and your mother raised a good kid too.
>>R
Rosie(shy): Thanks, Matt. It means a lot to hear this.
Rosie(smile): So, why did you and your grandparents move to Murfreesboro?
Matt: Well, because my great grandfather died, and he left his farm to my grandpa.
Matt(smile): It was his childhood home, and he's always wanted to grow old there too.
Rosie(smile): Makes sense.

Narrator: He flies up from the chair, and bolts out of the door, almost tackling a waiter on his way.
