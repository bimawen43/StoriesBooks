Rosie(sad): I'm a fidelity inspector. Mr. Silverstein hired me to test Mr. Dalton's loyalty to Ashley.
Brisa(surprise): No way!

Rosie: Yeah, so apparently Ashley and Matt are supposed to marry in the spring.
Rosie(sad): Mr. Silverstein wants Matt to take over the company but still wants to keep it in the family.

Rosie(smile): Exactly. Ashley doesn't know, and, of course, neither does Matt.

Rosie(confuse): If I can't get Matt to sleep with me before New Year's Eve...

Matt(confuse): These people are donating a lot of money, Ms. Winter.
Matt: The least we can do is to know who they are and thank them personally.
