Kate(surprise): Michael? What are you doing in my room?
Michael(sad): Why did you betray us, {Kate Name}? Why did you betray <i>me</i>?
Kate(sad): I...
A. I don't know what you mean!
B. I didn't betray you!
C. I can explain!
A
Michael(angry): Oh, really?
B
Michael(angry): Didn't you?
C

Kate(sad): I... I...

Michael(angry): I <i>trusted</i> you. 
Kate(sad): I had no choice! My sister-
Michael(sad): No matter what the situation, you always have a choice.
Julian: Always the preachy do-gooder. Jesus, you haven't changed a bit. 
Julian: I'm so tired of your judgemental, black-and-white world views.
Michael(angry): Get out of here, Julian.
Julian: Leave her alone, she doesn't want to hear your nagging. 
Julian(smile): Isn't that right, {Kate Name}? You did very well, by the way.
Julian(smile): You picked the right side.
Kate(sad): What?
A. I didn't pick sides! 
B. Stop being so cocky.
C. Please, you're making it worse!
A
Julian: Oh, but you have.
B
Julian(smile): But I thought that's what you like about me. 
C
Julian: I'm just laying out the facts, babe.

Kate(sad): You backed me into a corner!
Julian: Sure, keep telling yourself that.
>>
Kate(surprise): What are you doing here, by the way?
Julian: I'm here because you want me to be here.
Michael(sad): He's a criminal, {Kate Name}. The worst kind.
Michael(sad): You can't trust him.
Kate(surprise): I don't understand... why are the both of you in my room?
Michael: Julian's right. We're here because you want us to be.
Julian: You can't have the both of us, though. 
Julian(angry): I don't share.
Michael: You have to pick one, {Kate Name}.
Kate(sad): But-
Julian(angry): Which one of us, {Kate Name}?
Kate(sad): I... I can't... No!

Kate(sad): Oh god, it was just a dream.
Narrator: You lie back down for a while, as your heart beat slows back down to normal.
Kate*Think(sad): Guess a guilty conscience makes for restless nights.
Narrator: You think again about your phone call yesterday to Julian Castellano...
Narrator: How you told him everything about what the police were planning to do to catch him... 
Narrator: And feel sick to your stomach.
Kate*Think(sad): Jesus... what have I done?
Kate*Think(sad): How am I going to...
A. Handle going to work everyday? 
B. Pretend to be a good cop?
C. Face Michael?
A
Kate*Think(sad): To see the faces of everyone, while knowing full well that I'm betraying them?
B
Kate*Think(sad): Is this what I am, now? A dirty cop?
C
Kate*Think(sad): If he finds out, he'll never forgive me.
Narrator: The very thought of lying to him makes you feel sick again.
Narrator: Sick, sad... and angry with yourself.
Kate*Think(sad): He must never find out.

*Call To Michael (Scene: POLICE_STATION_DESK)
Kate(sad): Michael.
Michael: Hey, sorry for calling so early. I didn't wake you, did I?
Kate: No, I was already awake. Is something the matter?
Michael: Just good news. The informer called again this morning. 
Michael: Apparently the location for the deal has been chosen.
Kate(surprise): Oh! Where is it?
Michael: An abandoned subway station, the old City Hall station.
Michael: That's why I'm calling you. We'll go scope out the place this morning.
Kate(surprise): If it's been abandoned, how do we get in?
Michael: Take the 9.15 number six train towards Brooklyn Bridge, the terminus stop. 
Michael: But when the announcement asks you to disembark, don't. 
Michael: The train will loop around to go uptown and travel through the Old City Hall station. 
Michael: I've already requested that it stops there to let you disembark.
Kate: Take the 9.15 number six train right to the end, don't get off at the terminus. Got it.
Michael: Good. I'll meet you directly on the platform there.
*Hide Phone

Narrator: You get out of bed and take a quick shower.

Narrator: You hop off the number six train at the old City Hall station, having stayed on past the terminus stop like Michael instructed.
Kate*Think(surprise): Wow... it's beautiful!
Narrator: With its vaulted ceilings and brass chandeliers, intricate skylights and oak furnishings...
Narrator: The station is like nothing you've ever seen before.
Michael: It's something, huh?
Kate(smile): It wasn't quite what I imagined it would look like, no.
Narrator: Michael strolls up to you in long strides, his movements powerful and languid, and looking as gorgeously handsome as always.
Narrator: For a second, a memory of the dream you had last night flashes into your mind...
Narrator: And you have to consciously make yourself not look away guiltily.
>>
Michael: They certainly don't design subway stations like this anymore.
Michael: The architects of this station also designed the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.
Narrator: Michael points to the ceiling.
Michael: Look here, my favorite are the arched ceilings, designed by the Gustavino family.
Michael: Unfortunately, it was closed in 1945.
Kate(surprise): Do you know why it was closed?
Michael: The newer and larger Brooklyn Bridge subway station nearby had become more popular...
Michael: Because it could hold more commuters and accommodate longer trains.  
A. What a pity, it's definitely not as charming.
B. Old things have to make way for the new.
C. Hard to believe there'll be an arms trade here.
A
Michael(smile): I agree, it's a pity. I kind of have a preference for old world architecture like this, myself.
B
Michael(smile): Sometimes things have to fall apart to make way for better things?
Kate(surprise): Wait, did you just quote <i>How I Met Your Mother</i>?
Michael(smile): What, you think I'm too old to keep up with popular contemporary shows?
Kate(smile): No... but the last episode WAS six years ago.
Michael(smile): Touche.
C
Michael: I know. But it makes sense. 
Michael: It's abandoned, so there'll be no one else around.

Michael: Shall we get started?
Kate: What do we do?
Michael: We determine how viable this location is for the arms deal.
Michael: That'll help us determine whether or not the intelligence we received can be depended on.
Michael: We check out the possible entry and exit points... 
Michael: Whether there are hidden spots where we can run surveillance...
Michael: Where we can place our officers, how we can close in on them, etcetera.
Michael: Here's a copy of the map of the station and its platforms for your reference. 
Kate: Got it.
Narrator: The two of you spend the next hour scoping out the abandoned station, as Michael taught you more about what to look at, and what to note.
Narrator: He explains everything patiently, talking freely with you...
>>
Kate*Think(shy): When he's not being grumpy, he's really very nice.
Michael: There, I think we've just about checked out everything.
Narrator: He frowns slightly, as if deep in thought.
Kate: What's the matter?
Michael: Usually for an illegal trade... 
Michael: The parties will want to make sure there are several possible exit points. 
Kate: For quick escape if it turns bad?
Narrator: He nods.
Michael: That's right. That's the problem with this location.
Michael: They certainly don't have to worry about people stumbling onto them...
Michael: But there aren't any entry or exit points for them to make a quick escape if they have to.
Kate: Maybe there are, but we don't know about them yet?
Michael: Hmm... perhaps. We'll check with the Transit Authority regarding this, to confirm.
Kate: Michael... 
A. Thank you for being so patient with me.
B. Who knew? You're actually okay. 
C. Know what? I enjoy working with you.
A
Narrator: Michael blinks and flushes slightly.
Michael: No problem. Someone has to explain all this to you.
Narrator: He frowns.
Michael: Of course, it would have helped if you weren't a <i>total</i> rookie.
Kate(smile): Luckily I learn fast, then.
Michael(smile): Yes, at least you're a fast learner.
B
Narrator: Michael throws back his head and laughs.
Michael(smile): Wow, talk about a backhanded compliment.
Michael(smile): Thanks... I think.
C
Narrator: Michael chuckles.
Michael(smile): Thanks... I suppose working with you isn't too bad either.
Michael(smile): At least you're a fast learner.
Kate(smile): Oh wow, coming from you, that's practically a gushing compliment.
Michael(smile): Don't let your ego get too big now.

Narrator: Michael's expression turns serious.
Michael: {Kate Name}... I know we had a rough start to our working relationship.
Narrator: He rubs the back of his neck ruefully.
Michael: Truth is, it wasn't personal. 
Michael: I just didn't take kindly to the idea of having to work with someone else.
Michael: Working alone had always been my kind of thing, you know?
Kate: I know.
Kate*Think: Especially after having seen the way the others in the station gossip about you.
Michael: And then when you discovered who I was...
Michael(sad): It was like what I'd always had to face, happening all over again.
Michael(angry): The assumptions, the judgement.
Kate: Michael, you don't have to explain yourself to me.
A. You're the best partner I could have wished for.
B. It's all water under the bridge.
C. But maybe you can make it up to me...
A
Narrator: He laughs.
Michael(smile): I wouldn't go <i>that</i> far.
Kate(smile): No, seriously. I'm pretty sure I'm going to learn more working with you than anyone else.
B
Kate: Seriously, I've forgotten all about it.
Kate(smile): We're partners now, and that's what matters, right?
Kate(smile): <i>Partners in crime.</i>
Narrator: He groans at your lame attempt of a joke.
C
Narrator: His eyes flash as he looks at you.
Michael: Oh? And how can I do that?
Kate(smile): By... buying me coffee and donuts every morning!
Michael(smile): If you want.

Michael: Anyway, I guess I just want to say... sorry for my initial aloofness.
Narrator: His warm gaze is always too much to take.

*Gain KISSSUBWAY_05
Narrator: Unable to stop yourself, you lean in and kiss him gently on his mouth, closing your eyes and holding his face with your hands.
Narrator: Michael jumps a little, startled, but starts kissing you back immediately, gently at first...
*Michael Romance +1
Narrator: And then his kiss intensifies so quickly that you have no choice but to cling onto him, the only solid thing in a dizzy swaying world.
Narrator: Michael's arms wrap around your waist, your back, cupping the back of your head and twisting into your hair...
Narrator: And you wrap both your arms around his neck, your knees so weak you would otherwise fall down.
Narrator: You twine your fingers into his hair as well, gripping it, pulling him even closer, as close as you can get.
Narrator: The stubble on his face rubs your skin, a deliciously rough feeling that you can't get enough of.
Narrator: You suddenly understand why people describe kissing as melting, because every square inch of your body feels like it's dissolving into his.
>>>
Michael: God, {Kate Name}...
Narrator: Michael's voice is rough with desire, and it makes you shiver. 
Narrator: His lips slide down your jawline to your throat, the delicious sensation making you gasp, as he murmurs into your skin.
Michael: I kind of wish we weren't in a subway station right now.
Narrator: You can barely manage a coherent reply.
Kate(pleasure): Oh?
Narrator: You bite your lip as his hand travels down your waist, curving round your hips, and down your thigh.
Michael: The things I want to do to you right now...
A. What do you want to do to me?
B. Let me guess...
C. Someone could see us...
A
*Michael Romance +1
Michael: I want to kiss every inch of you... to taste you...
Michael: I want to slide myself into you... to take you... again and again...
Narrator: Your knees truly buckle then at his words, and you feel a desire for him burn in your lower belly.
Kate(pleasure): I want that too.
B
Kate: Would any of that, by chance, involve removing my clothes?
Michael: Yes.
Kate: What about your clothes?
Michael: Also yes.
Kate(smile): Sounds fun...
*Michael Romance +1
C
Michael: Nobody will see us.
Kate(shy): Michael! We're in a public place!
Michael: Mmm... are you telling me you don't want it too?
Narrator: You blush furiously, aware that your pounding heartbeat and shaking knees are giving your desire away.
Kate(shy): Michael...

Narrator: Almost as if your hand had a life of its own, you reach down and rub him between his legs...
Narrator: And gasp at the hard bulge that's straining against his jeans!
Michael: Now look what you've done. 
Kate: Sorry.
Michael(smile): How am I going to work with you as my partner?
Kate(smile): There certainly seems to be a lot of tension between us that we need to sort out.
Narrator: Michael leans in and whispers in your ear.
Michael: If we keep finding ourselves in this kind of situations, I can't guarantee what I'll do to you.
>>
Narrator: Then with a tremendous effort, he pulls himself away.
B
Narrator: You look away and cough awkwardly.
Kate: So, a good morning's work, huh?
Narrator: Michael takes your hint and follows your change of subject.
Michael: I'd say so, yes.

Michael: Anything you feel like in particular?
Kate: Hmm...
Kate: Can we go back to that Italian restaurant? 
Narrator: Michael grins.
Michael(smile): We definitely can.
Kate(surprise): Wait! How are we getting out of this place?
Narrator: Even as you ask, you hear the rumbling sound of a train approaching.
Michael: Ah, just on time. I arranged it with the Transit Authority, of course.
Michael: Come on, wouldn't want to miss our ride out of here.

Waiter: Buongiorno, Michael. Same table as always?
Michael: Yes please.

Message: Translation | I'll have the lasagne bolognese, thanks.
Michael: Prendero le lasagne alla bolognese, grazie.
Narrator: As you wait for your orders to arrive, the two of you go over your notes on the location again.
Michael: According to the informer, the date and time for the trade hasn't been set yet.
Michael: But he thinks it'll be some time next month, so we have one month to prepare for it.
Kate: What do we do next?
Michael: While Kelly and Lee work on gathering intel on the Russians who are supplying the guns...
Michael: We'll work on finding out who Julian intends to sell them to, that is, the end buyers.
Michael: And we'll bug Julian Castellano's warehouses.
Michael: It would be fantastic if we could bug his apartment too...
Michael: But that's been impossible so far. We can't get anyone in without being found out.
Kate: How about...
A. An officer masquerading as a house cleaner?
B. Getting them out by running a fake fire drill?
C. Sneaking someone in at night?
A
Michael: We thought about that, but he already has a house cleaner.
Michael: The wife of one of his men, and she's been working loyally for the Family for the past decade.
Kate(sad): Oh, that's impossible then.
Kate: How do you know that?
Narrator: Michael glances at you, but doesn't reply.
Kate: Oh, right. 
B
Michael: Believe it or not, we actually tried that five months ago.
Kate: What went wrong?
Michael: They left behind one man to guard the place.
Kate(sad): Why am I not surprised.
C
Michael: You mean like through the window? Down a chimney like Santa Claus?
Kate(sad): Sorry, guess that was a dumb idea.
Michael: Through a window might have been possible... 
Michael: Except all of them are locked, and also there are two guards on night watch every night.
Kate(sad): Wow, of course he has people on guard at night.
Kate: How do you know that?
Narrator: Michael glances at you, but doesn't reply.
Kate: Oh, right. 
***

Michael: Anyway, what we CAN do though, is to put surveillance on his apartment.
Michael: This way at least we know can keep track of everyone who enters and exits.
Narrator: You feel yourself turn cold.
Kate*Think(sad): I have to remember never to let myself be seen anywhere near there.
Narrator: The waiter arrives with your food, and the two of you eat in silence for a while.
Kate: Michael?
Michael: Yeah?
Kate: Is it hard to be by yourself, with no family?
Narrator: Michael remains silent for so long, you're just starting to think that he isn't going to reply after all... 
Narrator: When he finally speaks.
Michael: Even as a child I've always had, I guess what you could call, a complicated relationship with my family.
Michael: I loved my parents as a child automatically does...
Michael: But at the same time I hated what my father did for money.
Michael: Or how my mother supported him unconditionally, like a good Italian housewife.
Michael: I also found it harder and harder to get along with Julian as we grew into our teens.
Michael: Obviously, he didn't share my conviction that what our family was involved in was wrong, or hideous.
Narrator: Michael sighs and runs a hand through his hair.
Michael(sad): And then the shooting happened, and my mother died.
A. I'm so sorry.
B. How did the rest of your family take it?
C. How old were you when that happened?
A
Kate(sad): I'm so sorry. About your mom's death.
Michael(sad): Yeah well, it's just the kind of shit that happens in that world.
B
Michael(angry): Julian dropped out of school, and my father was just focused on getting revenge. 
Michael(sad): As if that could have brought her back.
C
Michael(sad): I was nineteen.
Narrator: The thought of Michael as a grief stricken, nineteen year old running out from his family makes your heart ache.
***
Michael: And for me that was the final straw, I guess.
Michael: I had to leave, cut off all relations with them.
Michael: I couldn't be a part of that world anymore.
Kate: I see.
Michael: Anyway it's better to be alone than to be a part of that, is what I'm trying to say.
Kate: Yeah, I get what you mean.
Michael: It must have been even harder for you. To have both your parents dying, and at such a young age...
Michael: And then to look after your younger sister, when you were just a kid yourself.
Narrator: You shrug, poking at your food with your fork.
Kate: They weren't the best parents. And it made me tough.
Michael(smile): You're tough, alright.
Kate(sad): I just wish my sister had less shitty parents.
Michael: She has the best sister, though.
Narrator: You smile wryly.
Kate(smile): I don't know about that.
Michael: I bet you'd do anything for her, right?
Kate*Think: You don't know the half of it.
Kate: I'd do anything to protect her.
Michael: See? Best sister in the world.
Narrator: You shift uncomfortably in your seat.
Kate*Think: Best change the subject before I reveal just how far I'd go for her.

Narrator: Michael's expression clouds over almost instantly, as he stares off into the distance.
Michael(sad): You mean Ava.
Narrator: He sighs, then turns back to you.
Michael: She lived next door to us, when we were kids.
Michael: The three of us were always playing together, we'd go to the park together, or each other's places.
Narrator: He flushes slightly.
Michael: When I was thirteen, I, er... had my first kiss with her.
Michael: Later on, I found out she kissed Julian too.
Kate: Oh wow... 
A. So the both of you were in love with her?
B. She led the both of you on at the same time?
C. Sounds like the beginning of a disaster...
A
Michael: I wouldn't call it love then... 
Michael: We were young, just starting to understand our growing feelings.
B
Michael: I don't think she did it on purpose.
C
Michael(sad): I guess so. You have to understand, we were all so young...
Michael(sad): Just starting to understand our growing feelings.
***
Michael: Ava herself was confused, I guess.
Michael: She couldn't seem to make up her mind about which one of us she preferred more.
Kate: So... she kept the both of you hanging on?
Michael: Not exactly. When we were sixteen, Ava started to hang out with me more and more.
Kate: Ah... and Julian didn't like it?
Michael: No, he didn't. He was convinced that he was madly in love with her...
Michael: Almost to the point of obsession.
Michael: But nobody could blame him, I guess.
Michael: Ava didn't exactly make it clear, she didn't really discourage him from continuing to chase after her.
Michael: Maybe she liked the attention... 
Narrator: He frowns slightly, his eyes troubled.
Michael(sad): Or maybe she loved him too.
Kate: How did she die?
Michael(sad): It was my fault.
Narrator: His statement sent a wave of shock through you.
Kate(sad): What do you mean?
Michael(sad): When we were eighteen, she slept with him... and I found out.
Kate(sad): Oh no...
Michael(sad): I broke up with her. She... she didn't take it very well.
Kate(sad): What happened?
Michael(sad): She killed herself.
Narrator: Michael closed his eyes, but not before you saw the grief and self loathing in them.
Kate(sad): Michael...
A. It wasn't your fault.
B. Are you still in love with her?
A
Kate(sad): You can't blame yourself. 
Michael(sad): It sure feels like my fault, though.
Kate: You did nothing wrong.

Kate: Yes, so we need to know all the possible entry and exit points of the old City Hall station.
Manager: On the IRT Lexington Avenue Line?
Kate: Yeah, the one that's been closed since 1945.
Manager: The only way to gain access to the station and its platforms is by train.
Manager: All the old entries and exits have been sealed off.
Kate: By sealed off you mean...?
Manager: Walled off. With cement.
Kate: Interesting. Thank you for your assistance...
Manager: Actually hang on, that's not strictly true. 
Kate: What do you mean?
Manager: There was one entrance that was restored for the 2004 Centennial Celebration.
Manager: It's locked though.
Kate: Who has the key?
Manager: It's kept in my office. Nobody else has access to it.
Kate: I see. Thank you for your help.
Manager: No problem.

Narrator: You hang up the phone, puzzled.

Kate: Maybe there's some other way.
Michael: You have some ideas?
Kate: Maybe they...
A. Have a train driver on their payroll?
B. Intend to go by the tracks on foot?
C. Had a copy of the key made?
A
Kelly: Hmm... it's possible. 
Michael: The only way to know for sure is to check the bank statements of every single train driver...
Michael: See if any one of them are on Castellano's payroll.
Lee(sad): That's massive.
Michael: Not to mention, impossible unless we get court-ordered injunctions to do so. For every one of them.
Kate(sad): It can't be done.
Michael: Not without any evidence to support this theory, no.
Kelly: I think it's more likely they had someone sneak into the manager's office... 
Lee: And made a duplicate of the key.
Narrator: Michael nods.
Michael: That does seem the most likely way for them to gain access, yes.
B
Kelly: You mean, run on the train tracks from the Brooklyn Bridge station all the way there?
Lee: Technically possible, but I can't imagine all those mobsters running on the tracks though.
