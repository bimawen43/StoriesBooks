Michael: He couldn't bring himself to kill her... because she resembles someone.

Levine: Yes, you want to eventually work in Narcotics.
Levine(smile): Anyway, it's still organized crime, isn't it?
Levine: You can still go into Narcotics after this case is wrapped up.
Levine(smile): Thing is, since it seems Castellano might have a soft spot for you ——
Kate(confuse): Just because he didn't have me killed?
