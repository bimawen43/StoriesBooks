Ramsey(sad): I was just discussing the treatment options with Amy earlier on, has she mentioned it to you?
Kate(surprise): No, she hasn't.
Narrator: You turn to Amy, just in time to see her shoot the doctor a warning look.
Kate(sad): Amy? What's this about?

Amy(terror): I... I was just about to.

Ramsey(sad): Amy is an adult and capable of making her own medical decisions concerning her treatment...
Ramsey(sad): But I hope that you can change her mind.
Narrator: The doctor leaves the room, and you turn towards Amy with a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach.
>>
Kate(sad): Change your mind about what? What decision did you make?
Amy(sad): Because it's so aggressive, they're recommending that I undergo chemotherapy, followed by radiation.
Kate(sad): And?
Amy(smile): And I told them I would think about it.
Kate(sad): ... Why, Amy?
Amy(sad): {Kate Name}... The treatment is expensive. How are we going to pay for it?
Kate(sad): I... I'll find a way. Amy, if it's the only way to cure this thing, you have to do it.
Amy(smile): I... okay.
Kate(sad): Don't worry about the money, Amy. That's my concern, okay?
Kate(sad): I'll take care of it.
