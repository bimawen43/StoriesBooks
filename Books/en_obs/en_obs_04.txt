Narrator: You wake from your drugged sleep, to find yourself lying on the floor in an apartment... with <i>Julian Castellano</i>.

Kate(sad): Where... where am I...?
>
Narrator: You struggle to get up into a sitting position, but the movement makes you nauseous, and you heave a dry retch.
Julian: Oh, the chloroform will leave you feeling sick for a while.
Julian: Sorry about that, by the way.
Narrator: Unbelievably, Julian Castellano is casually leaning against a wall...
Narrator: Arms nonchalently folded across his chest as he looks down at you lying on the ground.
Narrator: Even through the haze of confusion and fear, you feel a sudden bolt of anger, and you glare furiously at him.

Kate(angry): {*Attention You drugged me???}
(obs_04_01_be_drugged)
A. Are you crazy?
B. Why am I here??
C. Did you just <b><i>abduct</i></b> me???
A
Narrator: Julian Castellano shrugs.
Julian: I assure you I'm not.
B
Narrator: Julian Castellano shrugs.
Julian: I just wanted a little chat.
Kate(angry): You abduct people to chat with them?
C
Narrator: Julian Castellano shrugs.
Julian: I need to talk to you, and I had no choice.

Kate(angry): Let me go right now!
Narrator: Julian just continues staring at you.
Kate(angry): Did you hear what I said??
Narrator: A thought suddenly occurs to you, and a frisson of fear runs down your spine.
Kate*Think(sad): Maybe he changed his mind, and he's decided he's going to have me killed after all...
Kate*Think(sad): But then, why have me brought here?

Narrator: You glance around you. The room is modern and minimalist, but the few pieces of furniture in it are expensive and designer.
Narrator: You look out of the window. From what you can see, it still looks like New York. Specifically, a walk up apartment in Manhattan.
Narrator: Most importantly, Julian and you seem to be the only ones in the room.
Narrator: Surreptitiously, you reach for your gun...
Narrator: But find only an empty holster.
Kate*Think(sad): Damn it... they've taken my gun!

Julian: How much you look like her.
Kate(surprise): Who? Oh...
Narrator: You remember what Michael told you.
Kate: Like your dead girlfriend?
Narrator: His mouth twists into crooked, pain-filled smile.
Julian: You even have a mouth on you like her.
Julian(sad): She was never afraid of anything.
Kate(surprise): Okay...
(obs_04_02_you_like_her)
A. Well, neither am I.
B. Should I be afraid of you?
C. You abducted me to talk about your girlfriend?
A
Kate(angry): And I'm certainly not afraid of you.
Kate*Think(angry): Actually, I am... but I sure as hell am not going to show it!
B
Julian(smile): Most people are.
Julian: I can't blame them. They have good reason to.
Narrator: The sudden hard glint in his eyes makes you shiver.
C
Kate: Because you need to talk to a therapist about that, not me.
Narrator: Julian's face cracks into a smile.
Julian: What a mouth.

Narrator: It's disconcerting to talk to him while still sitting on the ground, emphasizing just how helpless you are at this moment.
Kate*Think(sad): I need to get up...

Narrator: It takes some effort, but you manage to get to your feet, just so you're not looking at him from the ground.

Julian: I'm not.

Kate(angry): Michael? Why don't you ask him yourself?
Julian: Has he told you yet?
Kate(sad): That he's related to you? Yes.
Julian(angry): No.
Julian(angry): {*Attention That he loved her too.}
Narrator: You're shocked by the sudden stab of pain that pierces you.
Kate(sad): Loved... who too?
Narrator: But you know the answer, even as the question leaves your mouth.
Julian(sad): Ava.
Narrator: Again, you feel that surprising stab of pain.

Kate*Think(sad): Michael... loved her too?
Kate*Think(sad): And... why does that hurt?
>
Narrator: Julian observes your reaction shrewdly.
Julian: Ah... he didn't tell you.
Kate(confuse): Is that why he's estranged from the family?
(obs_04_03_the_truth)
A. Because you were in love with the same woman?
B. Because you were hitting on his girlfriend?
C. Did she cheat on him with you?
A
Narrator: Julian doesn't reply. It seems you've hit the nail on the head.
Kate(sad): You were, weren't you? You were both in love with her.
Julian(angry): That has nothing to do with why he betrayed us.
B
Narrator: Julian rolls his eyes.
Julian(angry): First of all, no, that's not what happened.
Julian(angry): And secondly, that has nothing to do with why he betrayed us.

Julian: Fine. You drop into my life, bearing an uncanny resemblance to someone...
Julian: Not to mention you seem to have also caught Michael's attention rather quickly.

Narrator: So much has happened... Finding out that Michael is Julian's brother, Julian abducting you, and most of all...
Kate*Think(angry): I can't believe Julian wants me to spy for him!
Kate*Think(angry): I'm not a dirty cop!
Narrator: But then, you can't help but think about what he's offering you...
Kate*Think(confuse): Can he really help me to take down the drug cartels?
Kate*Think(confuse): And he'd pay for Amy's medical treatment.
Kate*Think(sad): I told her I'd find a way to come up with the money...
Kate*Think(sad): But really there's no way I'd ever be able to afford it.
Kate*Think(sad): But I can't possibly help him!
Kate*Think(sad): ... can I?
Kate*Think(sad): What would that make me?
Narrator: Finally, after several hours, you manage to drift off into a restless sleep, haunted by dreams of Michael, Julian, and your sister.

Narrator: You look forward to visiting Amy again at the hospital.
Kate*Think: I don't see her enough nowadays.
Narrator: You remember how thin she looks, the last time you saw her.
Kate*Think(sad): She must not be eating much, she probably has no appetite because of the chemotherapy.
Kate*Think(sad): Plus, God knows how awful hospital food is.
Kate*Think: Hmm, I should make her a special breakfast to cheer her up from her cancer treatment!
Narrator: Tutorial | Choose a special breakfast from three amazing choices to cook for Amy, and cheer her up at the same time!
Kate*Think(happy): I know! I could cook her favorite pancakes... or maybe some yummy quesadillas...
Kate*Think(happy): Or even Belgian waffles!

Kate: Yes it does. What about you? Have you had yours yet?
Amy: They should be bringing it round right about now, actually. And there it is.
Narrator: Right on cue, a hospital staff wheels in a trolley and places a covered tray onto the overbed table.
Narrator: You help Amy to sit up more fully, and remove the tray to uncover... an apple, two pieces of toast and a slab of butter.
Kate(sad): ...I should have bought you breakfast.
Amy: Why? This is fine. And the apple is good for me.

Kate: Have they started the treatment yet?
Amy: Yeah, they gave me the first round of chemo yesterday evening, after you left.
Kate(sad): Oh...
(obs_04_16_treatment)
A. How did it go?
B. How do you feel?
C. How long is the treatment?
A
Amy(smile): It went well! They gave it to me through IV. 
Amy(smile): It was a bit boring, but I just curled up in a chair with a book.
B
Amy: Okay so far. I'm just feeling a bit tired. They gave me anti-nausea medication.
Amy(sad): I have to be prepared for the nausea to get worse, though.
Narrator: You see Amy's lower lip quiver, as she fights to show a brave face, and you hold her hand.
Kate(sad): ...

Amy: They told me I'll have to do two cycles.
Kate: How long is each cycle?
Amy: Four weeks.
Kate(sad): Jesus! Two months of chemo!
Narrator: You see Amy's lower lip quiver, and immediately regret your outburst.
Kate*Think(sad): She's trying to stay brave. I have to be strong for her.
Kate: So what happens after that?
Amy: They'll evaluate to make sure the treatment is working. 
Amy: They told me most people have several cycles of chemotherapy. 
Amy: The treatment cycles may continue for as long as the chemotherapy works well.
Kate: Makes sense.

Amy(smile): Hey! It'll be fine! Don't worry!
Narrator: You smile at her. It's so typical of your sister to try to cheer you up even though she's the one going though it.
Kate(smile): I know it'll be fine. You're so strong, you're going to kick cancer's ass!

Narrator: She looks so fragile that a strong gust of wind might knock her off her feet.
Kate*Think(sad): I'll protect you, Amy.
Kate*Think(sad): Even if I can't fight this fight for you... I'll take care of everything else.
Narrator: And just like that, you make up your mind.
Kate: I've found a way to pay for all the treatment, Amy.
Amy(surprise): Really??
Amy(sad): Wait, you're not going to sell your body or anything like that, are you?
Kate(smile): Of course not.
Kate*Think: Just my soul.

Kate: I just have a quick call to make. I'll be right back, don't eat too quickly!
