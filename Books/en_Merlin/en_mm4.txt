Lancelot(sad): I can't imagine the dangers and challenges that await you.
Narrator: There is a moment of contemplative silence as the weight of the future hangs heavy over you.
Merlin(sad): I never imagined that one day I would affect the lives of so many people. Can I really do this?
Teague: Hmm. I might have something that could ease your mind a bit.

Narrator: Teague collects the dishes and steps away from the fire. He returns with s an old, worn box carved with mysterious patterns.

Narrator: He gently unlocks the box, and a strong purple light shines out of the gap.
Merlin(surprise): And this is...?
Teague: The crystal ball will answer any questions we ask and show us what will happen in the future.
Merlin(surprise): The future?
(mm_04n_09_predict_future)
A. I don't think that's possible...
B. What if it shows me failing?
A
Merlin: If you can see the future, why were you surprised to find me here?
Teague(angry): The future is not to be viewed lightly! I haven't used this in many, many years.
B
Teague: If there is danger in your future, knowing about it will help us prevent it.
Merlin(sad): That makes sense...
Merlin*Think(sad): But what if it can't be prevented?

Narrator: Teague places his hand on the crystal ball and mutters a spell. The ball fills with a tumbling cloud of mist.
Teague: Look into the ball.
Narrator: You hesitate just a moment before bending to peer into the surface of the ball...

Narrator: The man stands beside you, pulling on the hilt of a sword sticking out of an enormous stone.
Merlin*Think(surprise): That sword...!

Narrator: You rush forward to look at the stone and find that a faint stream of Lesola is running underneath it.
Merlin(surprise): There's a magical sigil here!
Narrator: You kneel down and try to make out the words on the sigil...

Narrator: Glowing Words | "Only the King of Light can pull the sword from this stone."
Merlin(smile): I've got it!

Arthur(surprise): What?
Merlin(smile): Pull hard on the sword and don't let go!
Arthur(sad): What do you think I've been doing this whole time?!
Merlin(happy): Just trust me!
Narrator: You kneel down amidst the shaking earth and heavy wind, and place your hands on the sigil.
Merlin(smile): Great Goddess of the Oak, please grant me your light!
Narrator: At your words, the sigil glows with a dazzling light, and a fierce shockwave shoots out in every direction.
Narrator: The wind tosses your hair and rips at your sleeves. The handsome man's armor clatters and clangs.
Arthur(surprise): What did you do?!
Narrator: <i>Boom!</i>
Narrator: You hear a loud noise, and the light of the sigil growing brighter until it shatters into thousands of pieces.
Merlin(surprise): Gah!
Narrator: As the light fades, the earthquakesdisappear.
Narrator: A large crack breaks across the stone, and a sliver of the sword's blade shines through.

Arthur(happy): We did it!
Arthur(happy): {Merlin Name}, pull out the Sword of Light together with me!
Narrator: The handsome man reaches his hand out  to you, and your fingers wrap around the hilt together.
Narrator: With little effort, the sword breaks free, dazzling you with its reflections of the sunlight overhead.

Teague(smile): That sword is legendary. It is hidden in the holy land of Avalon.
Teague(smile): It's the Sword of Light, and it can slay even the blackest of hearts!
Lancelot(surprise): Teague, are you talking about the Sword in the Stone?
Lancelot: Whoever frees the sword from the stone shall be the Chosen of the people...
Lancelot: But no one has ever been able to budge the sword...
Merlin(surprise): Really?
Teague(smile): {Merlin Name}, it is imperative that we find this man.
Teague(smile): Your fate, and the fate of the Druids, will be closely tied to this man!
Merlin(surprise): But...
(mm_04n_10_the_strange_man)
A. I don't know who he is!
B. How can you be sure?
A
Merlin(sad): I've never seen him before. How can I find someone I've never met?
Teague: You need to learn to think bigger, {Merlin Name}.
B
Teague: The vision was true. And you saw it yourself... 
Teague: The two of you pulled the legendary sword from the stone!
Merlin(sad): But where will I find him?

Merlin(sad): Yes, definitely.
Teague: {Merlin Name}, what you saw may come to pass, but the future is not set in stone...
Merlin(surprise): You mean, this hasn't happened yet? There's a chance to change the future?
Teague: The crystal ball allows you to see the most likely future, but there's more than one possible future.
Merlin(angry): Then I can stop it. I have to go back to save my parents! 
Merlin(angry): I can't let Lord Chesterfield take them away!
