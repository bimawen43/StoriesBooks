Merlin(shy): Excuse me...
Lancelot(smile): My fault for forgetting it's lunch time. You must be famished!
Merlin(sad): I'm so hungry that I could eat a cow.
Narrator: The two of you take a break on a rock by the roadside.
Lancelot(sad): I'm sorry I didn't realize...
Merlin(surprise): No, please... don't apologize.
(mm_01n_14_lancelot_apologize)
A. This is embarrassing enough as it is.
B. You're so sweet, Lancelot.
A
Lancelot(smile): There's nothing to be embarrassed about...
Narrator: You bury your face in your hands and hear him laughing.
Merlin(sad): Are you laughing at me?
Lancelot(happy): Sorry, no... It's just that you looked so adorable like that.
Merlin(shy): Adorable...?
B
Merlin(smile): You don't even know me, yet you've been kind to me all day.
Lancelot(shy): I was unaware I had to know someone before I could be kind to them.It’s a rarity finding someone so kind.
Merlin(smile): It's rare to find someone who's kind at all. 
Merlin(sad): Cruelty is much more common.
Narrator: Images of the young lord and his cronies laughing and cheering flashes through your mind. You shake your head to to clear your thoughts.
Merlin(smile): You're a good man, Lancelot. I'm glad I met you today.
Lancelot(happy): ...!

Narrator: He stares at you a moment, his eyes going soft, before he clears his throat.
Lancelot(smile): You know... If you're up for it, I could catch some fish for lunch.
Lancelot(happy): I make a mean grilled trout.
Merlin(surprise): But we don't have a fishing pole, or any nets...
Narrator: He makes a show of checking in all directions for eavesdroppers, then leans in close to you, whispering conspiratorially. 
>>>
Lancelot(smile): What if I told you I had a way of catching fish without any lines or nets?
>>
Merlin(smile): Then I'd have to accuse you of witchcraft, sir.
Lancelot(happy): Ha! It's nothing so amazing as that.
Merlin(smile): Then how...
Narrator: He shrugs with false, playful innocence.
Lancelot(smile): If you want to know... you'll have to let me show off for you.
Merlin(happy): Oh really?
Lancelot(smile): Yes. Let me take you fishing for lunch.
Lancelot(smile): You can take the leftovers home to your mother to help her recuperate.

Lancelot(smile): Yes. I feel at peace here.
Merlin(smile): I wouldn't expect something like this to exist so close to the ranch.

Lancelot(smile): Finding something so beautiful in a place filled with such ugliness makes it all the more precious.

Merlin(smile): So how do you plan on catching fish without a line?
Lancelot(smile): Allow me to demonstrate!
Narrator: When you turn around, Lancelot is already barefoot with his pant legs rolled up. He grabs a long sharp stick and wades into the water.

Lancelot: Stay calm, focus, slow your breathing...
Narrator: You pick out a target among the school of fish...

Merlin(angry): Hya!

Narrator: The thrust sloshes water all about. When the water settles, all you see is an empty stick.

Merlin(smile): Thank you.
Narrator: You and Lancelot lay down on the ground, enjoying the breeze and the scent of the wildflowers.
