Arthur(smile): This has been my favorite dessert ever since I was a kid!

Arthur(smile): {Merlin Name}, how much can you drink?
Merlin(smile): You are no match for me.
Arthur(smile): Woah! Braggadocio.

Arthur(happy): Don't worry... I've learned how to hold my liquor over the years.
Merlin(smile): I don't believe that.

Arthur(sad): Unfortunately, that will have to wait until tomorrow... 
Arthur(smile): The good news, however, is that you are not too drunk to stand. Can you still walk?
Merlin(shy): I can.
Narrator: As soon as you stand up, your head starts spinning, and you fall back in the chair.
Merlin(surprise): ...I take that back.
Arthur(smile): Be careful! I'll hold you.
B
Merlin(shy): Oh! Go back? No... I still want to drink...
Arthur(sad): Nocan do. Come on, {Merlin Name}, I'll help you walk.
Merlin(shy): No... Walking is hard....

Narrator: But Arthur takes it before you do, pours it into his mouth and shows you the empty glass.
Arthur(smile): Look, no more. It's time to go home now.
Merlin(surprise): You! Bad... You stole my drink!
Arthur(smile): Maybe I shouldn't have bought it for you in the first place
C
Arthur(shy): Although you have no idea what you are talking about, I'm still glad.
