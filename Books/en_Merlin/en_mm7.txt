A. Thank you for everything you did.
B. You mean Teague is behind the miracle?
A
Lancelot(sad): I naively thought the storm was God's will. If it weren’t for Teague...
Merlin(smile): Don't be modest. If you hadn't changed their minds, I'd probably still be at the stake.
Lancelot(smile): I didn't do anything. It was all Teague.
Merlin(sad): Lancelot...
B
Narrator: Lancelot pushes Teague over to you.
Lancelot(smile): Yes, his magic is amazing.
Merlin(sad): The king has declared magic to be evil witchcraft that deceives the people.
Merlin(sad): Aren't you leery of it, Lancelot?
Lancelot(smile): Real mages don't use magic to pull the wool over your eyes.
Lancelot(smile): On the contrary, they use it to show truth people usually don't see. Just as Teague did.
Teague(smile): Wise words, young man.   
Lancelot: I used to have prejudice against magic, just like everyone else.
Lancelot: But after all I have been through, I realize prejudice comes from ignorance.
Lancelot: Power itself is not the problem, it's the person who uses it. Just like Lord Chesterfield.

Teague: Relax, I didn't do anything evil...
Teague: I just used your blood to trigger one of the Caora... those magic orbs I kept from you earlier.
Merlin(sad): Then why did Nathair say you were the second person he saw who would dare cast blood magic?
Teague: Because most casters don't have enough power to handle a ritual of this magnitude alone.

Narrator: Asher | It was hell on earth. Wanton killings were everywhere. With no food or water, we had all but given up...
Narrator: Asher | However, a woman miraculously appeared and saved us. She was a ray of hope in the sundered ruins.
Narrator: Asher | She brought us an infant and asked us to raise the child.
Narrator: Asher | The war lasted for five years.

Asher(sad): {Merlin Name}, she didn't abandon you. She missed you all the time.
Asher(sad): At that time, melancholic music of the harp could always be heard on the battlefield.
Asher(sad): When the music of the harp played, even the birds would stop tweeting.
Asher(sad): Even the sound of wind would die down due to the deep longing in the melody.
Merlin(sad): Was the harp played by the High Priestess? I wish I had a chance to hear her play for me.

Teague(sad): {Merlin Name}, I will take good care of you for Lilith.
Merlin(sad): But the High Priestess... she will never come back.
Teague(sad):  She is not gone as long as people keep her memory alive.
Teague(sad): I can teach you a spell so that you can follow the music to the past and see Lilith's memories.
Merlin(surprise): Really? Is there such an amazing spell?
Teague: Every object has the memory of their previous owners on them.

Merlin(sad): I hope Teague is better now...
Narrator: Suddenly, you see smoke rising in the direction of your house, the blaze lighting up the sky.

Merlin(surprise): Father! Teague!
>
Narrator: You sprint home to see your father and Teague staring at the burned down house in a daze.
Merlin(surprise): We've got to put out the fire, Father!
Teague(sad): It's too late, {Merlin Name}.
Merlin(surprise): But the house! Where will we live?
Asher(sad): I don't need this house anymore. After you leave, I'll build myself a cabin in the forest.
Merlin(sad): But this is our home! Mother's memory, everything we own...
Asher(sad): Your mother's memory lives on in you, child... not in any physical objects.
Narrator: You watch the fire consume your childhood home, tears in your eyes.
Merlin(sad): Where will you stay tonight, Father?
Asher(sad): I will stay with our neighbors until I build up my own house in the forest.
Merlin(sad): Won't that take a long time?
Asher(sad): You doubt your old man? It won't take long at all.
Asher(sad): Please look after {Merlin Name}, Teague.
Teague: I will. 
Narrator: The house collapses with a resounding boom.
Asher(cry): Go, {Merlin Name}.
Merlin(cry): Father...

A. Take care of yourself.
B. I'll be back soon!
A
Merlin(cry): Or I'll feel guilty.
Asher(sad): Of course! I should learn to cook now!
Asher(smile): Next time, when you come back, I can make you a good meal!
Merlin(sad): Father... You shouldn't try to do the impossible...
Asher(smile): Hey, don't look down on your father like that!
B
Asher(cry): Don't worry about me, kid. Just focus on what you have to do.
Narrator: Your father pats your shoulder, giving you a reassuring, but awkward, smile.
Narrator: You throw yourself into your father's arms. He caresses your hair and hesitates, and then speaks.
Asher(smile): Come back... if you have a chance.
Merlin(cry): I will, Father.

Asher(sad): Alright, {Merlin Name}, you should go.
Merlin(sad): Father, I'll be back soon.
Asher(sad): I'll always be waiting for you in the woods, my child.
Teague: Let's go, {Merlin Name}.
Narrator: You quietly turn to follow him. 
Merlin(sad): Where are we going, Teague?
Teague: To Camelot. 
End
