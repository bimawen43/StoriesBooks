Crow_Merlin(sad): Teague! They are chasing me. Let's go!
Crow_Teague: What happened?
Crow_Merlin(sad): There's no time to explain...

Narrator: Guard's Voice | Where is that damn crow? I will beat it to death if I see it.
Narrator: Guard's Voice | Forget it. Just bad luck!
Crow_Merlin(smile): Teague, let's go!
Narrator: You fly back to the edge of the dungeon.

Merlin(sad): Father!
Teague: {Merlin Name}, stay here. I'll keep a watch over the corridor.
Merlin(sad): Thank you, Teague.
Narrator: As Teague fades into the corridor, you turn to your father. He stares at you, astonished.
*Camera Middle 1
Asher(surprise): {Merlin Name}! Is it really you? I thought I saw a crow.
Narrator: Your father rushes to the bars, clutching your hands between his warm, calloused palms.
Narrator: You remember when you were a child, he used to hold your hand like this when you were sad. Your hand was so much smaller then.
Merlin(sad): Father, it's really me.
Narrator: Your father searches your face, his eyes lit up. 
Asher(smile): Kate, it's {Merlin Name}. She came for us!
Kate(sad): {Merlin Name}? My child! Let me see you!
Narrator: Your father hurries to bring her to the bars.
Narrator: Your mother struggles with all her might to sit up, trying to touch your face.
Narrator: You feel the coldness from the tip of her fingers. Tears pour from your eyes.
Merlin(cry): Mother...

A. I will make them pay!
B. I shouldn't have gone into the manor. It's all my fault.
A
Merlin(sad): I will make that bastard pay for what he's done to you!
Merlin(angry): He treats us like dirt! He's killing people for fun!
Kate(sad): My child, you can't do that. I just want you to be safe.
Narrator: She reaches out to place her hand on your cheek. You lean into her touch.
Kate(sad): All I want is for you to be safe, my darling girl.
B
Merlin(sad): I'm sorry, Mother.
Merlin(sad): None of this would have happened if I hadn't provoked Lord Chesterfield. 
Kate(sad): My child, stop talking about this. I'm just glad you're safe.

Narrator: A sudden pain comes upon your mother. She drops her hand, biting her lips, trying to endure the pain. Her body trembles like a leaf.
Kate(sad): I'm so happy to see you again... one last time...
Merlin*Shout(sad): No! I'm getting you out of this place!
