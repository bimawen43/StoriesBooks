Narrator: With Dracula and the Night brothers, you make your way back into the bathroom.
Narrator: Sneaking away for a moment, you hide a small belch from your heavy breakfast before having a seat.
Narrator: The Night brothers fight over the seat closest to you, surrounding to the next closest.
Narrator: All except for Liam, who walks in with a box of paperwork that he tumbles onto the table closest.
*Dracula Face Draculaface_2
Dracula(happy): Now then. What is our plan to prove my innocence?
Narrator: Derek approaches the mountain of paperwork.
Narrator: He pulls out a stapled document as thick as a tome.
Derek: Here's the police report.
Derek: At 2:23 a.m. on the 18th moon of this year, your wife Mary was found dead in her home.
Narrator: Dracula grinds his teeth, a twinge of emotion hitting him that he hides.
Narrator: From everyone except you. He pulls his eyes away from you, pretending it never happened.

Derek: Mary was drained of blood. The child- your boy- was beheaded and also drained of blood.
Derek: Mary was still alive when the child was murdered.
Narrator: The violence of the murder startles you as you study the faces of the men in the room.
Narrator: Looking for emotional cues, you're only met with stone cold apathy.
Eve*Think(surprise): These vampires are clearly accustomed to death. All of them seem unphased.

Eve*Think(surprise): But that's a gruesome way to go...
(iatw_09_01_the_police_report)
A. That's horrific.
B. That's not that bad.
C. There's no way that's what happened.
A
Eve(sad): I can't believe that!
Eve(sad): I think I'm going to be sick...
Dracula(angry): If you're going to lose the contents of your stomach, I suggest you do so outside.
Sabastian: There's a latrine down the hall.
Eve(sad): I'm fine.
Elijah: Anyway... Sire.
B
Eve(sad): I mean, that's gruesome for sure, but I've heard worse.
Dracula(happy): Of course you have. You're human.
Dracula(happy): Trust me, {Eve Name}.
Dracula(happy): No creatures in the world are quite as spectacular at murder than humans.
Elijah: Anyway... Sire.
C
Sabastian(surprise): What do you mean?
Eve(sad): That's horrific. Someone actually did that?
Dracula(angry): What did you think this trial was about? Someone stole my car?
Dracula(angry): It's murder, little girl. Get used to it. Our world is lousy with it.
Dracula(happy): Not quite as much as yours, I suppose. But lousy nonetheless.
Elijah: Anyway... Sire.

Elijah: You are being charged with two counts of murder, two counts of unlawful draining of blood.
Elijah: And two counts of violating the Non-Violent Vampire Act.
Narrator: Liam clears his throat, a small growl in his voice.
>>
Liam: I'm only going to ask this one more time, Vlad. Did you kill your wife and child?
Dracula(angry): I did not kill them.
Narrator: He replies through gritted teeth, his eyes fixated on the brothers seemingly tired of saying that.
>>>
Dracula(angry): But I will make the person who did this pay.
Dracula(angry): They will feel the wrath of Vlad the Impaler as no one has ever felt it.
>>
Dracula(angry): They will know pain better than anyone in this world. Then they will die.
Narrator: There's a cruel gleam in his eyes that sends shivers up your spine.
Eve*Think(sad): It's not hard to imagine him being responsible for the death of tens of thousands of people.
Eve*Think(sad): I mean... this is Dracula in front of me. Vlad the Impaler.
>
Eve*Think(angry): I remember learning in history classa bout him. Romania in 1462. 
Eve*Think(angry): He killed so many as a ruler.
Eve*Think(angry): He reveled in the bloodshed.
Eve*Think(sad): Savored ripping the heads off his enemies.
Eve*Think(confuse): Drinking their blood as it poured from their skulls. He enjoyed it.
Narrator: Your eyes linger on Dracula as his mind lingers on his murdered wife and child.
Eve*Think(sad): But seeing him now. Like this. A poor man with a murdered wife.
Eve*Think(confuse): I just don't see that monster in front of me. Do I?
(iatw_09_02_angry_dracula)
A. I'm sorry you lost your family. (Cost: 15 Diamond ID: plot_iatw_09_dracula)
B. You're a monster.
C. Whatever.
A
Eve(sad): That sounds... horrific.
Narrator: Your comment catches Dracula off guard, your sentiment and empathy unfamiliar to his cold attitude.
Dracula(sad): Yes well... thank you. I appreciate that.
>>
Eve(sad): It doesn't matter who you are. What you've done.
Eve(sad): Nobody deserves to lose a spouse like that.
Dracula(sad): She was the love of my life.
Eve(sad): How did you two meet?
Dracula(happy): A boring story, I'm afraid.
Eve(surprise): Really? I find that surprising from someone like you, Dracula.
>
Dracula(happy): Aye, my life has always been swirls of chaos and excitement. 
Dracula(happy): I've always yearned for love that wasn't so.
Dracula(happy): My wife and I found love that was... simple. She was mine and I was hers.
Dracula(happy): And in its simplicity was something more powerful than I've ever felt in all my years.
Dracula(happy): She made me feel loved. She made me feel special. She... was all that mattered to me.
Narrator: Dracula stops, his words slicing his heart. He wipes a tear from his eye.
Dracula(sad): Please, boys. You must help me.
Dracula(sad): Allow me to bury her knowing this culprit has been brought to justice.
>>
Dracula(sad): Please... give me that closure.
Narrator: Stepping close to Dracula, you hold his hand in yours.
Eve(sad): We will find whoever did this. On her death I promise you this.
Narrator: Your words cut through his pain as you lock eyes with him.
Narrator: He nods, reassured.
Derek(happy): I must say, {Eve Name}, you are nicer than anyone I've ever met.
>
Elijah(happy): It's comforting to hear such empathetic words, my lovely.
Derek(happy): Yes, I do believe we don't hear enough of them in our world.
Derek(happy): Our kind has accepted your world's title as "monsters" to heart, I'm afraid.
*Sabastian REL +1
Sabastian(happy): But not all of us are monsters.
Elijah(happy): Why, I like to believe we are most enjoyable. 
Liam(angry): That isn't to say you shouldn't be scared of us, girl.
Derek(angry): Nonsense, Liam. {Eve Name} should have nothing to fear from us. Ever.
Narrator: The brothers turn to you, looks of endearment on all of their faces, except for Liam.
Derek(happy): You are always safe when you're around us, my dear.
Elijah(happy): We promise you that here and now. Until your last day.
Eve(happy): Well, thank you. I mean it. I never was good at pulling off relationships. Happy to hear I'm doing this right.
Narrator: Elijah slides close to you, his hand inching close to your side.
Narrator: The near impact of his soft hands to the small of your back sending hot electricity through your bones.
>>
Elijah(happy): And quite stylishly, too.
Elijah(happy): Forgive me for saying this, {Eve Name}, but you are beauty in its purest form.
Eve(happy): Well... thank you.
Elijah(happy): I can't wait to get to know you better. Open you up to our world. Everything we have to offer.
Narrator: Elijah leans in close, whispering with a flirty wink.
Elijah(happy): Everything I have to offer.
Eve(happy): Can't wait.
Narrator: Elijah leans back, clearing his throat.
Narrator: He turns his attention back to Dracula and this case.
Dracula(sad): Yes well... thank you.
Narrator: Sabastian smirks at you, happy to hear your warmth lighting the atmosphere.
B
Dracula(angry): Excuse me?
Eve(angry): It sounds to me like you murdered them.
*Sabastian REL -1
Sabastian(angry): {Eve Name}, please. We're lawyers. We're here to be objective. Learn the truth.

Dracula(angry): I didn't kill my wife, little girl.
Dracula(angry): And if you wish to remain of that opinion, I don't believe I ever asked for your help.
Dracula(sad): Especially from a human.

Elijah: Since you didn't kill your wife... what happened?
Sabastian: How did someone manage to kill your family in your own home and leave without you seeing?
Derek: And who would dare to do such a thing?
Derek: Your reputation precedes you, Vlad. There are few monsters in this world as feared as you.
Derek: Doing something like... this. Requires a level of courage few possess.
Eve: Or anger. This could be an act of revenge.
>>
Sabastian: True. So what do you recall, sire?
Narrator: Dracula's spine stiffens.
*Dracula Face Draculaface_1
Dracula: The night that it happened, I left to feed. When I returned they were dead.
Dracula: My butler didn't see or hear anything.
Eve*Think(surprise): He has a butler! I didn't know that.
Dracula: No leads have turned up for any suspects other than me.
>>
Eve(surprise): Are there any witnesses that can confirm you left to feed?
Eve: If you can prove you weren't in the house at the time of the murder, that'll prove it wasn't you.
Dracula(angry): Only the deer I drained, I'm afraid. And that beast was dead from the start.

Eve*Think(sad): Hmm... My gut is telling me that...
(iatw_09_03_the_gut)
A. Dracula is innocent.
B. Dracula is guilty.

B

>>
Eve: So what's the plan for today?
Liam: Well you have given us a list of your enemies. I will visit them one by one.
Liam: Squeeze any information I can out of them.
Derek(happy): Elijah and I will research any previous cases relevant to this.
Elijah(happy): Any vampires convicted of a murder that was found not-guilty, we need to know why.
Derek(happy): Liam, you look for witnesses.
Derek(happy): Testimonies of any creatures that may have seen Dracula that night.
Liam: Our best bet would be proof that Dracula wasn't at home the night his wife was murdered.
Liam: But I seriously doubt we'll get that lucky.
Elijah: But any testimonies would help. 
>
Eve(surprise): And what should I do?
Eve: I could help research old cases. Maybe interview witnesses?
Sabastian(happy): No. You have a sharp mind. Possibly sharper than ours.
Derek(happy): Agreed. We need to expose as much of this case to you as possible.
Sabastian(happy): As such, you and I will be traveling to the coroner to inspect Dracula's deceased wife.
Sabastian(happy): My brothers and I will take you to the crime scene after.
Elijah: And to speak with any and all of Dracula's close friends.

Eve*Think(sad): That sounds...

A. Fun!
B. Boring.

Eve(happy): I'm happy to hear I won't be stuck in that library all week.
Eve(happy): Talking to Dracula's closest buddies should be fun.
B
Eve(angry): I don't want to go around interviewing people.
Eve(angry): I want to learn about the legal case! Learn about the justice system of this world.
>
Eve: Let me go back to the library to study.
Elijah(sad): That's not the best way to utilize your unique skills, {Eve Name}.
Liam(angry): Understanding our world requires more than a book, {Eve Name}.
Liam(angry): You need to learn about our world. And that will require you to go out and experience it.

Eve(angry): Ugh. Fine.

Dracula: Do what you must.
Dracula: Remember boys, if you absolve me of this unfair charge you will have your freedom.
Eve*Think(sad): Yeah, and they're going to use that freedom to kill themselves!
Eve*Think(sad): I can't forget that I need to spend this time convincing them that life is worth living!
>
Dracula(angry): I will return tonight. Get to work, my sons.
*Camera Middle 2
Narrator: And with that, Dracula stands and quickly escorts himself out.
Narrator: Liam grabs the list of Dracula's enemies, stuffs it in his coat pocket, and saunters off.
Derek: Elijah and I will be studying in the library. Let us know if you need anything, {Eve Name}.
Elijah(happy): Or just want to chat. Grab a drink. Head upstairs to de-stress.
Narrator: Your cheeks blush a rosy red as Elijah winks.
Narrator: Derek and Elijah whisper at each other, giggling about something.
Narrator: Sabastian approaches you, hands in his pockets.

Sabastian(angry): We're in over our heads with this case. I can feel it. Are you ready, {Eve Name}?
Narrator: You gaze up at Sabastian, who appears none too happy to be doing this.

Sabastian(surprise): Lighten up? That's the advice you throw at me?
Sabastian(surprise): As we're investigating the highest profile murder case in the paranormal community?
>
Eve(happy): That's exactly my advice.
Eve(happy): There will always be something that gives us an excuse to be miserable.
Eve(happy): Our job is to find the reasons to be happy.
Eve(happy): To make joy and gratitude more of a habit than misery and excessive amounts of stress and worry.
Narrator: Sabastian looks down at you, his face unreadable. Finally, he responds.
Sabastian(happy): You're very wise for such a young human.
Narrator: You make an exaggerated scrunched face.

Eve(happy): I'm not that young. Sheesh. You old guys think everyone is young.
Sabastian(happy): Old guys?
Narrator: His stern face cracks a smile despite himself.
B
Eve: I'm ready.

Eve: My stomach is still in a knot after hearing about that gruesome double murder.
Eve: This is a serious business. Lives are at stake. This needs to be taken seriously.

Sabastian: We should head over to the coroner immediately.

Narrator: Just then, the front gate swings open as Lily jumps in.
Lily(happy): Mornin' Sab! {Eve Name}! 
Lily(happy): So happy to see you again. We're going to the Otherworld this morning?
Eve(surprise): Lily? I guess it shouldn't surprise me that you're driving this thing.
Sabastian(happy): She's a dryad, so she has a handful of magical abilities. One is mythical travel.
Eve(surprise): Seriously?
Lily(happy): Sure, boss woman. My uncles have clients all over the globe. We go where we need.

Lily(smile): It burned for a fortnight. My home was nearly destroyed in the blaze.
Lily(happy): It killed my family and nearly killed me.
Lily(smile): Luckily, Grandma Matilda saved a seed from my tree, a seed of my soul.

Narrator: Luckily, Sabastian saves you, stepping close to the stone beasts.
Narrator: Clearing his throat, Sabastian speaks in a language you've never heard before.
Eve*Think(surprise): What on earth did he just say? It sounded like... <i>ooblacky jambonick kay</i>.
Narrator: But whatever he said moves their fixated eyes from you onto him.

Narrator: Eventually, the gargoyle on the left blinks, its mouth exuding dust and moving.
*Stop Sound
Sabastian(happy): Greetings, Akuro.
Akuro: What does the Son of Night seek in the place of the dead?
Narrator: Its voice is like gravel.
Sabastian: We seek the wisdom of the Ifrits in our investigation of a wrongful death.
Narrator: The gargoyle, named Akuro, exhales deeply from its nostrils.
Narrator: You inhale sharply, the scents of stone and earth mixed with cedar hit you.
Narrator: Just then, Akuro turns to you.
Akuro: No humans are allowed entrance.
Akuro: You may enter, Sabastian Night.
Akuro: But this thing doesn't belong inside. It doesn't even belong in this world.
>>
Eve*Think(sad): That's rude...
(iatw_09_10_rude_akuro)
A. Stay quiet!
B. Excuse me?!
C. You're right.
A
Narrator: You bite your lip, refusing to acknowledge the insult.
B
Eve(angry): What's your problem?! Do you have cement for a brain?
Sabastian(sad): {Eve Name}, please. Let me handle this.
C
Eve(sad): I am human. If I can't pass, I understand.
Sabastian(angry): No. You're coming with me.

Sabastian: I know she is human, but she is under my protection. She works for The Night Firm.
Akuro: Come here, young one.
Narrator: You slowly mosey your way over, timidly with tiny steps until your face is close to Akuro's.
Narrator: Akuro breathes into you, pondering. But your scent only seems to give it confusion.
Akuro: Human?
Sabastian: Yes, she's human.
Narrator: But something strange happens. The gargoyle gazes at you, perplexed.
Eve*Think(surprise): Why does Akuro look like it doesn't believe Sabastian?!
Akuro: Well then, human. If you desire to enter, you must do this.
Akuro: Tell me what you know.
Eve(surprise): Excuse me?
Narrator: The gargoyle sharpens its gaze with narrowing eyes.
Akuro: Tell me what you know.
Narrator: Just at that moment, something deep inside of you clicks.
Narrator: Your head feels like a door deep into the corner of your mind has finally opened.
Narrator: And a powerful force deep inside your bones compels you to whisper something.
Eve(sad): <i>"... touch its head..."</i>
Akuro: Tell me what you know.
Eve*Think(surprise): What is it talking about?!
(iatw_09_11_akuros_question)
A. Place your hand on its head. (Cost: 20 Diamond ID: plot_iatw_09_akuro)
B. I don't know anything.
A
Eve*Think(sad): I don't know why, but my body seems to be telling me to place my hand on its head!
Eve: I will tell you what I know.
Narrator: It feels like something else has taken over your body.
Narrator: Something unfamiliar. Terrifying. Foreign, but almost as if it has been inside you all along.
Narrator: You gently place your hand on the top of the gargoyle's head.
Narrator: The stone is cold to the touch, a bit wet from a previous day's rain.
Narrator: And as you do, a vision overtakes you. Exploding into your eyes like a dream.
Narrator: You're no longer in the cemetery. You're on the highest imaginable mountain.
>>
Eve*Think(surprise): Oh my God! What's going on?!
Narrator: At the very peak of the mountain are two gargoyles, curled up close to one another.
Eve(sad): I see... I'm on a mountain. There are two gargoyles. They're holding each other.
Narrator: You slowly approach the gargoyles and realize one is Akuro.
Eve: It's you. With another gargoyle. You're...
Narrator: Trapped in your vision, you slowly approach the two gargoyles and see what they're cradling.
Narrator: It's a baby gargoyle, curled in Akuro's arms. The other gargoyle gently caresses the baby.
Narrator: They share a loving smile, holding their child with love.
Eve(surprise): Oh my God. You're holding a baby. Your baby.
Narrator: With that line, your lips begin moving out of your control.
Narrator: It feels as if something more powerful inside of you takes over.
Eve: Akuro. Your child will be born atop a mountain. She will be healthy. Safe. Beautiful.
Eve: She will fly to the highest peaks. Hike the lowest valleys. Live the life you've always wanted.
Narrator: And with those words, your hand slips off the gargoyle.
Narrator: Your legs give out from under you, falling into the wet grass below you.
Narrator: Sabastian leaps over, catching you before you plop in the mud.
>>>
Sabastian(angry): What have you done to her, Akuro?!
>
Akuro: I've done nothing. She is the one that is in control.
Eve(sad): I'm fine. I'm okay.
Narrator: You rise back onto your feet.
Narrator: But as you look up at Akuro, you don't find any anger. Contempt. Confusion.
Narrator: Tears gently fall out of Akuro's eyes, as deep of an emotion you've ever seen in a stone monster.
Akuro: Thank you, Wise One. Thank you for that blessing.
Sabastian(surprise): What the hell was that?!
Eve(surprise): Why did I see all of that?! Did you do that to me?
Akuro: Gargoyles have no such power.
Akuro: Sabastian, Your companion has the gift of vision.
Eve(surprise): What?!
Sabastian(surprise): How is that possible?
Akuro: I do not know. But I suspected she was more than human after smelling her.
Akuro: You have many unanswered questions, {Eve Name}.
Sabastian(sad): No... That's impossible.
B
Narrator: The gargoyle stares at you with its dead, granite eyes.
Akuro: She is but a baby, unfamiliar of her own self.
Akuro: As such, she is no threat to us or the morgue.
***
Akuro: You know a great many things, son of the Night. A lawyer. A vampire.
Akuro: You are wise for your years, Sabastian Night. But there is one thing you are wrong about.
Akuro: This young one. Your travel companion.

Akuro: Human she is not.

Eve(surprise): What?! Of course I am. I was born on earth. I have human parents.
>
Akuro: Human you are not.
Narrator: And with that, Akuro reverts back into its original position before you had approached.
Akuro: She may enter for your business.
Sabastian: Thank you, Akuro.
Eve*Think(angry): What the hell is that gargoyle talking about?!
Sabastian: Come on, {Eve Name}. We need to hurry.
Narrator: Your mind swirling with questions that you struggle to scoff aside.
Narrator: Walking past the gargoyles, you stroll into the mysterious, black morgue.
