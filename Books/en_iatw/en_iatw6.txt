Narrator: You pry your eyes open to meet Sabastian, his jaw clenched and face conflicted as he carries you through the hallway.

Narrator: Nearly puking it back up, you force the vile brew down your throat.

Sabastian(smile): Lily is our druid that makes our potions.
Sabastian(happy): She enchanted that one with a sweet smell to hide how disgusting it truly is.
Sabastian(happy): You can blame Lily for that one.
Eve(sad): You sure it's not going to kill me?
Sabastian(smile): It's harmless to drink, and will help your heart pump the blood back into your system.
