Eve*Think(surprise): Oh my God! It's Sabastian!

Eve*Think(surprise): Is he the one conducting the interview? This is where he works?
Narrator: You continue staring at Sabastian with wide eyes. His gaze falls to the ground as he adjusts his seat.
Sabastian: You seem surprised to see me.
Eve(surprise): Well of course I am!

A. Why didn't you tell me you were interviewing me?
B. It's good to see you again.
C. I can't believe you're here.

*Sabastian REL -1
Sabastian(angry): How was I supposed to know your interview was here?
Eve(angry): How many other job interviews take place in the middle of the night?
Narrator: Sabastian shrugs with indifference, a smirk crawling on his face.
Sabastian(angry): Maybe I wanted to get some honesty before you sat down here.
B
Sabastian(happy): Likewise.
C

Sabastian(happy): Believe it.
Sabastian(happy): I told you we'd see each other again.

Narrator: But before he can finish, the door behind him swings open.
Narrator: Another man walks in.

*Play Music m_intense_sprightly_connection
Narrator: He's just as tall as Sabastian, though his build is leaner.
Narrator: His stylish hair falls perfectly in place.
Narrator: You can hear his shoes echoing through the room as he walks towards his seat.
Narrator: You can't see his shoes, but you assume they match his perfectly tailored suit.
Narrator: Your eyes linger on his suit that somehow fits better than Sabastian's.
Narrator: He glides through the room with ease, not even looking at Sabastian.
Narrator: You hold your breath, a moment of impulse washing over you as you imagine running your hands along his suit.
Narrator: Finally, he clears his throat and has a seat opposite to Sabastian.
*Derek Name ???

Derek(happy): Sorry I'm late. Been one of those nights.

Narrator: He finally looks at you and you lock eyes. You're entranced, almost hypnotized by his gaze.
Eve*Think(surprise): This man is gorgeous!
Narrator: As if he read your mind, he smiles and waves at you.
*Derek Name Derek
Derek(happy): I'm Derek. Good to meet you.
Eve*Think(surprise): Who is this man? Does he work here with Sabastian?
Eve: ...

A. You're gorgeous! (Cost: 15 Diamond ID: plot_iatw_02n_derek)
B. You look like Sabastian.
A

Narrator: Sabastian turns to you, scowling.
Sabastian(angry): You tell that to every person you meet now?
*Derek REL +1
Derek(happy): You'll have to excuse my brother. He can sometimes get jealous of my superior looks.
Eve(surprise): brothers?! I had no idea.
Eve*Think(happy): Although that explains why they look similar.
Eve: I'm {Eve Name}.
Derek(happy): It's lovely to meet you. 
Derek(happy): Would you be offended if I told you that you looked stunning?
Eve(happy): Only if you'd be offended if I told you that you looked hot.
Narrator: Smirking, Derek slides into the seat next to you, leaning in close.
Derek(happy): When I imagined the person we were going to be interviewing...
Derek(happy): I always hope it's someone that looks like you.
Eve(happy): What, sexy?
Derek(happy): Smart. And judging by the quickness of your quips, I feel my hopes are right.
Derek(happy): I'm excited that you meet my assumptions.
Eve(happy): Well I can do a lot more than that, I'm afraid. In a lot of ways.
Derek(happy): I can't wait to find out.
Narrator: Sabastian clears his throat and rolls his eyes, grumpy that you're flirting with his brother.
Narrator: But Derek's eyes linger on you, clearly uninterested in Sabastian's hesitations.
Narrator: Eventually he stands up, adjusting his suit and returning to the other side of the table.
Derek(happy): I must say I was happy to hear someone responded to the ad.
>
Derek(happy): For its simplicity, I must admit that the ad is anything but eye-catching.
Derek(happy): But I'm happy it caught yours. My brother here and I ——

Eve*Think(happy): Although that explains why they look similar.
B
Derek(happy): Well I certainly hope so. We're brothers after all.

Eve(surprise): Brothers?! I had no idea.
Eve*Think(happy): Although that explains why they look similar.

Derek(happy): Yes, well I was born with the looks. And the brain.
Derek(happy): Sabastian here was born with the impatience and temper.
Narrator: Sabastian scoffs and rolls his eyes, seemingly only confirming what his brother is saying.
***
Eve(happy): I didn't know you had a brother, Sabastian.
Narrator: Sabastian grunts, still seeming to be upset at you about something.
Narrator: Derek pauses, eyeing both of you with a puzzled look.
Narrator: He points at you as a smirk crawls along his face, revealing dimples that make your knees weak.
Derek(happy): Do you two know each other?
Eve(surprise): Uh...
(iatw_02_03_know_each_other)
A. No, we don't.
B. We met on the subway over here.
A
Sabastian(angry): That's right. Never met her.
Derek(happy): You never were a good liar, brother.
Sabastian(angry): Doesn't matter. She's here for the interview. Let's get to the interview.
B
Sabastian(angry): No, we didn't.
Eve(angry): What? Yes we did.
Derek(happy): You never were a good liar, brother.
Sabastian(angry): Doesn't matter. She's here for the interview. Let's get to the interview.
Narrator: Sabastian pulls his eyes from yours.
Narrator: Derek raises an eyebrow to his brother Sabastian.
Derek(happy): You took the subway?
Narrator: Sabastian shrugs, still refusing to look your way.

Eve*Think(sad): But I had no idea he would be interviewing me!
Eve*Think(sad): He was just the hot stranger on the subway.
Derek(happy): I apologize for the long wait, {Eve Name}.
Derek(happy): We had an emergency with a client that took longer than expected.
Eve*Think(happy): Well that explains why I was waiting out in the lobby for an hour...

A. That's no problem.
B. That's annoying.

Eve(happy): It's not like I have any appointments after this besides going to bed.
*Derek REL +1
Derek(happy): Yes, of course. Thank you for taking the time out of your night to visit us.
Derek(happy): We totally understand how unfamiliar this may be.
>
Derek(happy): I assure you we have our reasons.
B
*Derek REL -1
Derek(sad): An unfortunate preoccupation, I'm afraid. But please me assured this is not typical for us.
Derek(sad): And I must add, our job requires us to work unpredictable hours, and that would include you.
Derek(sad): So your ability to handle flexible time is key for you to work with us, {Eve Name}.
Derek(sad): I'm afraid your impatience is not telling of a good candidate.
Narrator: Derek scribbles something on a notepad in front of him that can't be good.
***
Derek(happy): Once our other brothers arrive, we can begin. 
Eve*Think(surprise): Brothers? There are more of them? How many?
Eve*Think(surprise): This is turning out like nothing I expected.
Eve*Think(surprise): Should I use this time to get to know their business?

Narrator: Each one is more beautiful than the last.
Narrator: The air around you cracks with unseen electricity.
Narrator: For a moment you wonder if you're the only one that can feel it.
Narrator: The four of them together are overwhelming your senses.

Eve(happy): Hello! It's good to meet you all.
Derek(happy): You too! Not many folks responded to the ad. You're a sight for sore eyes indeed.

B
Narrator: You shift in your seat again, getting more comfortable.

Narrator: One of the brothers, with beautiful blond hair and pale blue eyes looks your way.
Narrator: Just as tall as Sabastian, the man steals the air from the room with his presence.
Narrator: He adjusts his cuffs, flexing his shoulders that nearly rip his tailored suit.

Elijah: My name is Elijah Night.
>
Narrator: Elijah hops over to your side of the room and shakes your hand before having a seat.
Narrator: The handshake linger, his warm, soft hands cocooning yours. 
Narrator: Your hand begs for the moment to last forever.
Narrator: But that logical side of your brain kicks in again as you pull your hand away.
Eve*Think(sad): I need to stay focused! I'm in a job interview!
Narrator: Elijah points to the final brother you have yet to meet. He's already sitting down.
Elijah(happy): This is my brother Liam Night.
>>
Liam(angry): Pleasure.
>
Narrator: Liam is less excited as Elijah to meet you, his head buried in some paperwork he's brought in.
Narrator: Liam barely gives you the respect of a glance before returning to whatever is in those papers.
Narrator: But Elijah's longing gaze is everything you would need. His eyes capture you as you nod and smile.
Eve(shy): I'm {Eve Name}.
Elijah(smile): And we are the Night brothers. So happy you made it to the interview.
Elijah(happy): Shall we begin the interview?
Derek(happy): Yes! All four brothers are here, so we shall begin.
Narrator: You stare like a deer in headlights, all four of these beautiful, tall men staring back at you.
Narrator: For a brief moment, your body tells you to just run. Jump out of your seat and make a break for it.
Narrator: Thankfully, the logical side of your brain kicks in, and you consider otherwise.
Narrator: You clear your throat, giving yourself a moment to process this.

Eve(happy): Well I'm happy to be here. This job sounds... interesting.
Eve(happy): And before I say anything, I feel like I should clear the air.
>>
Derek(surprise): What do you mean?
Eve(sad): Well... as Sabastian may have told you, I ran into him on the subway.
Liam(angry): Our kind shouldn't be using such archaic methods of travel, brother.
>
Eve(surprise): Our kind? What are you talking about?
Narrator: The brothers immediately wave your question off, pretending it doesn't exist.
Derek(angry): Nothing. Doesn't matter. Please continue, {Eve Name}.
Eve(happy): Anyway... I ran into him on the way here and we chatted.
Eve(happy): I told him that I have a passion for drawing.
Sabastian(angry): And...
Eve(angry): And... that I didn't really want this job. That I've always wanted to draw professionally.
Elijah: I see. Well you can understand our concern since you're applying for a position here.
Eve(happy): Yes, but please understand. I have many passions. I'm a passionate person.
Eve(happy): And I've needed to find mediums to express them. Drawing will always be important to me.
Eve(happy): It's the only way of expressing the intense feelings inside of me.
Sabastian: And even I must admit that she has quite the talent for it.
Eve(happy): No job can satisfy everything within me. And I don't expect this job to.
>>
Eve(happy): But please don't hold that against me.
Eve: And please don't think for a second that this impacts my ability to perform the tasks of this job.
Derek(happy): Very well. We appreciate your candor, lovely. We will keep that in mind. 
Elijah(happy): And don't be so sure of that, {Eve Name}.
Eve(happy): Don't be so sure of what?
>
Elijah(happy): That one job can't satisfy every passion somebody has.
Elijah(happy): You may find that this one does.
Elijah(happy): After all, we're known for satisfying passions.
Narrator: The brothers turn to you, their electricity zapping you in the chest.
Elijah(happy): Now then. Should we begin this interview?
Derek(happy): Yes.
Narrator: Elijah turns to you.
B
Narrator: You wave your hand to the Night brothers, awaiting their questions.

Elijah(happy): If you're nervous that's understandable.
Elijah: It's unusual for this many people to interview you.
Eve(happy): So that's Sabastian, Elijah, Derek, and Liam.
Narrator: You point to each brother as you list them off.

Derek(happy): Well she's good at names. Gotta give that to her.
Elijah(happy): And beautiful. Let's not forget to mention that.

Narrator: Sabastian grunts at his brother's compliment, but you don't even care.
Narrator: Elijah studies you with his pale blue eyes, like ocean water.
Narrator: He's a bit shorter than his brothers, but only by an inch or two.
Narrator: His eyes bore into you, you can feel a deep burning in your soul.
Narrator: A warmth spreads over you. You feel like you're melting under the heat of it all.
Narrator: But that's probably just the nerves kicking in.
Narrator: But Derek snaps you out of it, turning to his brother to discuss business.
Derek(surprise): Everything go okay?
Liam(angry): It's handled.

Derek(happy): To address your previous question, the role you're applying for is a bit unusual.
Eve*Think(angry): That seems pretty obvious already.

A. I figured.
B. How so?
A
Eve(angry): Especially after you dragged me here in the middle of the night.
Elijah(happy): Yes. Fair point.
B
Elijah(happy): Well. It's a strange job.

Elijah(happy): We need someone to manage schedules and help with clients.
Derek(happy): Assist with any investigations, emergencies, or events that may arise.
Narrator: You nod.
Eve(sad): Okay...
Eve(sad): I mean, I'm definitely capable of doing that, but ——
Derek(happy): And we're not an ordinary firm.
Eve(confuse): What does that mean?
Liam(happy): You'll be working from sundown to sunup.
Derek(happy): And our location frequently changes, so it's something of a live-in position.

Eve(surprise): Live in? I'd have to live here? In an office building?
>
Derek(happy): No, don't be silly.
Elijah(happy): That would be very uncomfortable!
Eve(smile): Oh. Good.
Derek(happy): You'd live in our home. With us.
Eve(surprise): What?! I'd live with the four of you?
Derek(happy): And our grandmother.
Elijah(happy): And other staff.
Eve(surprise): I don't know how I feel about that...

Eve(angry): Plus...

Narrator: Your nerves tingle, a flash hitting you with a wave that nearly makes you vomit.

Eve(sad): Where is your home exactly?
Narrator: The brothers turn to each other, all of them stumbling to answer what feels like such a simple question.
Derek(sad): Well... that's sort of... complicated.
Liam(angry): No it's not. Our home just... moves. It changes from time to time.

Eve*Think(surprise): Grandmother! That's their grandmother?!
Eve(surprise): I had no idea you were their grandmother!
Matilda(happy): Oh yes. I am Matilda Night. Such a pleasure to meet you.
Matilda(happy): I'm the grandmother of these boys. If they give you any trouble, you just let me know.
Matilda(happy): Now I brought snacks for everyone.
Narrator: She gives a pointed look at her grandsons. Relief washes over you.
Narrator: Her presence relaxes you. She feels like an ally for you. Someone rooting for your success in this moment.
Narrator: It could just be because she's standing on your side of the table.
Narrator: But it feels deeper... As if she carries empathy and warmth that only a grandmother could have.

Matilda(happy): That is, if our guest would like some tea.

Matilda(happy): What do you say, {Eve Name}? Care for a break from this interview?

Narrator: The teacup warms your hands.
Narrator: She also passes out for goblets to each brother, all of them thick and dark, gold in color.
Narrator: They accept each one, taking long gulps.

Eve(surprise): Not drinking tea?

Narrator: They shake their heads no at you, Elijah smirking at the idea.
Narrator: You can't help but wonder what they're drinking. Water? Booze?
Narrator: The mystery is left unknown.
Narrator: But you can't help but notice Sabastian wipe a rich, thick red stain away from his lips after his gulp.
Narrator: You take a small sip of tea. It's a beautiful symphony of flavors in your mouth like nothing you've had.
Narrator: The bitter notes, but perfectly balanced sweetness.
Narrator: The rich, deep flavor is impossible to place, even for a veteran tea drinker such as yourself.

Narrator: The room is covered with leather-bound books.
Narrator: It smells of spices and wood and earth.
Narrator: On one of the walls is a desk covered in scrolls, with books and jars lined on the shelves.

Narrator: Back in the castle room, you hop over to the fire, hoping the warmth will help.
Narrator: But it doesn't. The buzzing in your head grows to screams as you clutch the sides of your head.
Eve(sad): Aghh! Stop! Please!
Eve*Think(sad): What is going on? Why is this happening to me?!
Narrator: You scramble around, struggling to think of your next move.

Narrator: You grip the door and swing it open with ever bit of force you can muster up.
Narrator: Wincing your eyes shut, you crawl into the room and slam the door shut.
Narrator: A cold wind cuts through your skin, chilling you to the bone. It feels like you stepped into a basement.
Narrator: You open your eyes.

Narrator: Your jaw drops.
Narrator: You were expecting any number of things for this room to be.
Narrator: A broom closet, a standard office. Maybe a waiting room?
Narrator: It feels like you've been transported to a castle in an age of magic and wizards.
Eve*Think(surprise): Uhhh. What?!
Eve*Think(surprise): Where am I?! How is this possible?
Narrator: The shock nearly forces you to forget about the excruciating pain in your head, but only for a moment.
Narrator: You turn back around towards the door you just entered, making sure you didn't just lose your mind.
Narrator: But it's the same door. To the law firm lobby.
Eve*Think(surprise): Where am I?! Did I just transport somewhere?! Am I even on Earth right now?!
Narrator: But before those questions can be answered, the pain returns, shooting something awful through your head and spine.
Narrator: You hop over to the fire, hoping the warmth will help.

Narrator: You're too late. The door opens again as all four brothers join you in the castle room.
Narrator: You turn to them, your expression of fear and confusion throwing them off.

Derek(sad): {Eve Name}! Are you okay?

Narrator: You open your mouth to answer, but nothing comes out.
Narrator: Your knees finally give in as you tumble to the ground.

Elijah(surprise): Oh my god!
Narrator: You can see the cold, stone floor nearing your face... suddenly you're caught by one of the brothers.
Narrator: You slowly open one of your eyes to see which of the brothers caught you. Maybe Derek? Elijah?
Narrator: They seemed the nicest.
Narrator: But it's not.
Narrator: It's Sabastian, cradling you in his arms.
Elijah(surprise): Get her on the sofa! Quickly!
Sabastian(angry): What the hell is wrong with her?
Liam(angry): She's going to pass out.
Narrator: The castle door swings open again, but your eyes are too weak to see who it is.
Narrator: But your ears clue you in where your eyes have failed. It's Matilda, their grandmother.

Matilda(surprise): Oh my goodness! Get some potions! Quickly!

Eve*Think(surprise): Potions?! What on Earth is she talking about?!

Narrator: But before you can muster any words, your eyes roll to the back of your head.
Narrator: The last thing you feel is Sabastian's warm arms resting you on the soft sofa in the room.
Narrator: Your body can't take much more,you finally pass out.
