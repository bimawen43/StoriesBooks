Eve*Think(confuse): What did Sabastian want me to wait here for?
Eve*Think(sad): Should I call him? I don't even have his number.

Narrator: It slowly parks, the passenger door right in front of you.
Narrator: You step back, expecting the passenger door to shoot open so some fancy person can step out.

Narrator: A fragrant scent of lavender hits your nostrils as soon as you step in.
Narrator: Your exposed skin tickles to the air, the limo seemingly set to a perfect temperature of comfort.
Narrator: Small, colorful lights illuminate the inside of the beautiful interior of the limo.
Narrator: Close to you is an open bottle of champagne, bathing in a silver vase of ice.
Narrator: Two champagne glasses sit next to it, shimmering the lights in their reflection.
Eve*Think(surprise): Is this how the Night brothers travel?

*Lily Name Lily
Lily(smile): I'm Lily.

Lily: I'm a lot of things. But one of these things is a driver, yes.
Lily(smile): Your driver.
Eve(confuse): I have a driver now?
Lily(happy): Oh honey. You have a lot of things now.
Lily(smile): Now buckle up. You won't be alone for this little ride.
Eve(surprise): I won't? Who's coming with me?
Narrator: As if on cue, the limo door swings open as Sabastian glides into the seat close to you.
// Narrator: Sabastian turns to Lily.
Sabastian(smile): Lily. Let's head home.
Lily(happy): 'Ay 'ay, captain!
Narrator: Lily slides up the divider as the limo zooms off.
Sabastian: Like Lily said, {Eve Name}. Buckle up.
Sabastian(smile): You're in for <color=red>one HELL of a ride</color>.
