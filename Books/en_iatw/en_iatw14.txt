Narrator: The wooden chair in the witness box isn't any more comfortable than your last one.
Narrator: Your eyes catch Sabastian on the other side of the courtroom.
Narrator: You can smell the smoke radiating from Dath'Racul's scales. His tail whips behind you.
Narrator: It reminds you of a campfire. Those camping trips you and Adam went on as kids.
Eve(surprise): ...
Narrator: Court is back in session after the recess, but the room is in complete silence.
Narrator: Everyone's staring at you. The Night Brothers. The audience. The jurors.
Narrator: But worst of all, Jerry. His eyes stare daggers into your soul.
Narrator: You feel his hatred. The horrible pain he's caused you.
Narrator: Every second of his abuse runs through your mind.
Narrator: You don't want to think about it, but you need to.
Narrator: Because calling him out right here, right now, is the only way to discredit his testimony.
Narrator: To save Dracula and the Night brothers.
Eve*Think: I don't know if I can do this.
(iatw_14_01_be_character_witness)
A. Turn away.
B. Ask Dath'Racul to be excused.
C. Leer back at Jerry.

Narrator: You turn away, hiding your face from everyone.
Eve*Think(sad): God... I can't do this. I'm not strong enough.
B
Eve(sad): Sir. Your honor. I'm so sorry. I don't think I can do this.
Eve(sad): Please... if I could just return to my seat.
Racul: No. You have been called as a character witness.
Racul: You are not leaving your seat until the questioning has completed.
C
Narrator: You squint your eyes at Jerry, sending back only hatred his way.

Narrator: Tapping the top of the wooden box with your fingernails, a sigh fails to calm your nerves.
Narrator: Sabastian raises from his seat, giving paperwork one last glance.
Sabastian: If it pleases the court, your honor. {Eve Name} is a character witness.
Racul: You may begin your examination of this new witness, Sabastian.
Racul: Then Moira may begin her cross-examination.
Narrator: Sabastian approaches you, caressing his warm hand against yours.
Narrator: For a brief moment, time stops. You lock eyes with him.
Narrator: He smiles, his face filled with something powerful.
Narrator: Your heart zaps away your anxiety. Your nerves finally soothe away and melt.
>>
Sabastian(happy): It's okay, {Eve Name}. He can't hurt you ever again.
Narrator: You nod, smiling back. Sabastian turns back, pacing around the room.
Sabastian: {Eve Name}. Do you know that man right there?
Narrator: Sabastian points to Jerry, squatted beside her sister, Moira.
Eve*Think(surprise): What should I say?
(iatw_14_02_know_jerry)
A. Yes
B. No.
C. He's a piece of garbage.
A
Eve: I do.
B
Eve(sad): I don't.
Sabastian(surprise): What? Isn't that Jerry, a man you used to have an intimate relationship with?
Eve(surprise): Oh, yes! Sorry...
C

Moira(angry): Objection, your honor.
Moira(angry): Seeing as my brother isn't something you throw into a trash can...
Moira(angry): ...the witness is being slanderous, disrespectful, and unreliable.
Racul: Sustained. Watch yourself, {Eve Name}. Give objective answers only.
Narrator: Sabastian motions with his hands for you to take it easy. You nod.

Eve(sad): Oh. Sorry.
Eve(sad): Yes, I know him.

Sabastian: And how do you know Jerome Van Helsing?
Eve: He was my therapist in the mundane world. I started seeing him after my brother Adam committed suicide.
Eve: But Jerry and I got together while I was his client.
Sabastian: It would seem to me dating a client would cross a professional boundary.
Eve(smile): Yeah. A big one.
>
Moira(angry): Objection, your honor. My brother's practice outside of this case is irrelevant.
Sabastian(angry): On the contrary, Ms. Van Helsing.
Sabastian(angry): {Eve Name} is here as a character witness to Jerome Van Helsing.
Sabastian(angry): His practice outside of these walls is all there is to discuss here.
Sabastian(angry): If deemed unprofessional, this invalidates his testimony against our client, Dracula.
Racul: I agree with Sabastian Night on this.
Racul: Overruled, Ms. Van Helsing.
Racul: Dr. Helsing's professional behavior is relevant to this case. Continue, {Eve Name}.
Narrator: Even from this far away, you can hear Moira grind her teeth in frustration.
>>
Sabastian: Please, {Eve Name}. Continue speaking about your experience with Jerome Van Helsing.
Eve: At first it was professional. I poured my heart out to him for several therapy sessions.
Eve: But he started pushing that professional boundary. Started calling me at night.
Eve: He said it was to check up on me. Make sure I was doing okay.
Eve: He'd ask me questions in session that weren't related to Adam. To just... get to know me.
Eve: I didn't know what it's like to have a therapist. I just thought he was being nice. He was flirting.
Eve: And I grew feelings for him.
Eve(happy): He listened. Talked to me about Adam.
Eve(happy): He was everything I needed at the time.
Eve(sad): Which for me is usually...
(iatw_14_03_with_jerry)
A. Someone to talk to.
B. Someone to hold.
C. Someone to sleep with.
A
Eve(sad): We would spend hours chatting.
Eve(sad): Talking about nothing. Everything.
B
Eve(sad): He'd hold me for hours.
Eve(sad): Wrapped around his arms I felt... safe.
C
Eve(sad): Our relationship turned physical immediately.
Eve(sad): I need that in a partner, and he took care of me that way.
***
Eve(sad): But most importantly...
Eve: He told me everything was going to be okay now that he's here for me.
Eve(sad): And that's exactly how he trapped me.
Sabastian(sad): Please. Expand on that, {Eve Name}.
Eve: Once we got together, he insisted that I stayed his client.
Eve: He said it would be too suspicious if we ended our sessions and went public.
Eve: We just... couldn't tell anyone. He told me if anyone found out he'd lose his license.
Eve: So I kept it a secret. I was his secret. I was hidden away from his world.
Eve: It was nice, especially after losing Adam. My brother was my whole life.
Eve: I... had someone again.
Eve: But what I thought was romantic secrecy ended up being isolation.
Eve: He didn't want me seeing friends. Talking to others.
Eve(sad): If I did he'd punish me by giving me the silent treatment.
Eve(sad): Or worse, he'd yell at me. Call me names.
Sabastian: And that's when his abuse escalated and he got physical with you?
Eve(sad): Um... yes.

Eve(sad): The first time he hit me... well he was drunk.
Eve(sad): He showed up at my apartment. Begged me to let him in.
Eve(sad): He was so mad. Pacing around my apartment. I had no idea why.
Eve(sad): He accused me of cheating on him. That I went out with some guy. But I hadn't.
Eve(cry): He kept yelling. Threw a glass against a wall.
Eve(cry): I got so scared... I didn't know what to do. I just kept telling him it wasn't true.
Eve(angry): But he called me a liar. He shoved me against a wall and starting choking me.
Eve(angry): I nearly passed out before he let go. I fell to the floor crying.
>>
Narrator: You can still feel his hands on your throat. The panic as the air squeezed out of your lungs.
Narrator: The growing fear that you're going to die in that moment.
Narrator: But you lock eyes with Sabastian, the love behind his iris soothing your anxiety.
Eve(cry): Eventually Jerry helped me back up. He hugged me. Cried with me.
Eve(cry): He apologized. Begged me to forgive him.
Eve(sad): He told me how scared he was that he did that.
Eve(sad): He promised he that he'd never do it again.
Eve(sad): The worst part is... I believed him.
Eve(cry): I started thinking it was my fault that he attacked me.
Eve(cry): And told myself that I need to watch what I do.
Eve(sad): I convinced myself that I was in control of his behavior.
Eve(angry): But it was only an illusion of control. He knew what he was doing.
Eve(angry): The physical abuse escalated from there.
>>>
Eve(cry): He broke my arm. Punched me.
Eve(cry): But it's not the physical abuse that gives me nightmares.
Eve(sad): It's the control he had over me. The fear.
Eve(sad): The dread that's so impossible to describe.
Eve(sad): It's... feeling trapped by your partner.
Eve(sad): The person that's supposed to support you. Take care of you.
Eve(sad): The person that's supposed to love you is hurting you.
Eve(angry): I lose sleep for the person I've turned into.
Eve(angry): The parts of me broken. The scars inside that may never heal.
Eve(sad): The pieces of me he's rotted away forever.

Narrator: It's Sabastian that breaks the silence, his voice timid and sharp.

Eve(cry): I'm sorry. I can't go on.
Narrator: A tear falls down your cheek. The whole courtroom is quiet.
Sabastian(smile): It's okay, {Eve Name}. You're doing great.
>
Sabastian(angry): Your honor, my witness has reported emotional and physical abuse by Jerome Van Helsing.
Sabastian(angry): While she's not strong enough to describe it to us...
Sabastian(angry): ...We must only imagine what she's been through.
Moira(angry): So we can only speculate this alleged abuse? I'd ask the jurors to be skeptical of that.
Narrator: Sabastian turns to the jurors, deep in consideration, before turning back to you.

Sabastian(sad): Why didn't you just leave the relationship? If you knew this was wrong, why stay?
Narrator: And that's it. The question every friend asked you. The question that burns in your head every day.
Narrator: You pause, collecting your thoughts.
>>
Eve(sad): Being in an abusive relationship... it's like you're in the passenger seat of the car.
Eve(sad): But someone else is driving. You don't know where they're going. But they're driving too fast.
Eve(sad): They're swerving around, nearly crashing. You beg them to stop. Slow down.
Eve(sad): But they only speed up every time you say something. So you just clutch on for dear life.
Eve(sad): Tell me, would you open the passenger door and just... jump out?
Eve(sad): Even if the fall doesn't kill you, you're just... stranded alone on the highway.
Eve(sad): Survivors of domestic violence are most likely to be killed after the relationship ends.
Eve(sad): I was convinced Jerry would kill me if I left. So I didn't. I couldn't.
Sabastian(sad): We understand, thank you for sharing that, {Eve Name}.
Sabastian(sad): We understand how hard that must have been.

Narrator: And all four of them are gazing at you. Not with pity or guilt.
Narrator: But with admiration. Smiles.
Eve*Think(happy): They must be impressed with what I just did!
Narrator: And it's in this moment that you have a realization you should have had long ago.
Eve*Think(happy): The Night brothers... they actually care about me.

Sabastian: I'd ask the jurors to please remember...
Sabastian: The Van Helsings have a documented history of problems with vampires. One with plenty of violence.
Sabastian: Given {Eve Name}'s testimony, it's worth questioning Jerome's intentions in this case.
Sabastian: Given this information, I call into question his capacity to analyze Dracula professionally.
Sabastian: If Jerome is unable to abide by the professional standards of his own profession...
Sabastian: If Jerome is unable to abide by the standards of our own moral compass...
Sabastian: How then can we trust his assessment of Dracula?
Sabastian: And how do we know Jerome isn't lying to us all to harm the woman he has abused for years?
Sabastian: We live in a world of monsters, ladies and gentlemen. Never forget that.
Narrator: Sabastian turns to you, smiling.
Sabastian: But someone once told me that being a monster doesn't mean you have to act like one.
Sabastian: Dracula loved his wife. He loved his family. 
Sabastian: And all we know is that Jerome Van Helsing couldn't recognize love even when he tried.
Sabastian: Nothing else, you're honor.

Narrator: You glare back at Moira, anger rustling in your stomach.
Eve(angry): It's not like there's a club, Moira.
Moira(angry): So you have no evidence supporting any of your claims, correct?
Narrator: Words stumble from your lips. Only silence.

Moira(happy): A fiery passion that likely led to him taking her life in a fit of rage.

Eve: Yet not enough to prove anything.

Moira(sad): Technically, no.
Eve: As for your claim that Dracula likely killed Mary because he has killed before...

Narrator: But footsteps ahead of you cause you to jump. Someone followed you.
Narrator: The only person in the world that would follow you.
Jerry(happy): Well, well, well.
Eve*Think(sad): Oh God.
Eve*Think(sad): Jerry followed me here!
>>
Eve(angry): What are you doing here?
Jerry(happy): I saw your face when you looked into the Memory Catcher.
Jerry(happy): I know what that stupid smile on your face means.
Jerry(happy): You only have that look when you realize something huge.
Jerry(happy): I know you better than yourself, {Eve Name}.
Jerry(angry): Figured you saw the crow up there.
Jerry(angry): The only animal here that could have possibly seen me kill Mary.

Eve(surprise): {*Joyful What?! It was you?!}

Eve(happy): Perfect! Now I just need to see what the crow saw on the night of Mary's murder...
Narrator: And with that thought it jumps to that night.
Narrator: An owl hoots. The forest rustles.
Narrator: You see the cat from before, hiding in the bush.
Narrator: Liam steps forward, his feet in front of the cat.
Eve*Think(surprise): Well now we know for sure that was Liam's feet.
Narrator: But the memory continues, this time with a significantly better view.
Narrator: After a few short minutes, you see Liam hug Mary, both of them smiling at each other.
Narrator: As Liam takes his leave, he and Mary wave bye to each other.
Eve*Think(surprise): Liam was telling the truth! He was only there to help heal Mary!
Narrator: And as Liam leaves, it's only a matter of seconds before Mary has a second visitor.
Narrator: A shadow of a man creeps out from within the nearby forest.
Narrator: He carries a small blade, gripping it with a clenched fist as he sneaks around the villa.
Eve*Think(surprise): Oh my God. That's the murderer! But who is it?
Narrator: You lean in closer, your nose nearly pressed against the glass.
Narrator: Mhe man finally steps out of the shadows and into the moonlight.
Narrator: But his face makes you jump. You nearly fall out of the tree and drop the glass ball.
>>>
Eve(surprise): Impossible!
Narrator: It's Jerry.
Narrator: Not just your abusive ex. Not just a werewolf.
Narrator: But the man who murdered Mary.
Narrator: Snarling with an anger you know all too well, you watch him sneak into the villa with his knife raised.
Eve*Think(surprise): Oh my God! Jerry <b>killed</b> Mary!
Eve*Think(surprise): But why?! To frame Dracula?!
Eve*Think(surprise): This doesn't make sense. But I gotta get this back to court!
>
Narrator: Leaping out of the tree, your feet slam into the clay pavement below.
Narrator: But footsteps ahead of you cause you to jump. Someone followed you.
Narrator: The only person in the world that would follow you.
Jerry(happy): Well, well, well.
Eve*Think(sad): Oh God.
Eve*Think(sad): Jerry followed me here!

A. It's over, Jerry.
B. You murdered Mary!
C. How did you know to follow me?
A
Eve(angry): I know everything.
Jerry(happy): Oh, it's anything but over, you little weasel.
B
Jerry(happy): The little wench had it coming.
Jerry(happy): How else were we going to rid our world of those vampiric scum?
C
Jerry(happy): The way you ran out of the courtroom.
Jerry(happy): I know what that stupid smile on your face means.
Jerry(happy): You only have that look when you realize something huge.

Jerry(happy): I gotta admit, I'm impressed you figured it out.
Jerry(happy): Not even those foolish vampires thought to check the memory of that crow.
Jerry(happy): You thought you were so clever, going up on the stand and attacking me.
Jerry(angry): Sharing your lies with everyone.
Eve(angry): Nothing I said on that stand was a lie!
Narrator: But he only shrugs you off, content and unconcerned.
Jerry(happy): Doesn't matter, I suppose.
Jerry(angry): Because you're not leaving this place with your life.
Narrator: He exhales sharply, wincing like he's in pain.

Werwolf(angry): Hrr!
Narrator: But he throws his head to the sky, flexing every muscle in his body.
Narrator: Brown fur swarms over every inch of his skin. His teeth elongate.
Narrator: When he opens his eyes, you step back in horror at what he's become.
Narrator: What was once your abusive ex is now a werewolf.
Narrator: He's no longer the Jerry you knew.
Narrator: He's the Jerry he always was.
Narrator: A monster.
Narrator: He steps closer, claws drawn.
Narrator: A snarl.
Narrator: Then he leaps at you.
