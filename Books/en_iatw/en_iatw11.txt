Narrator: It's a short ride back to the mansion.
Narrator: but the carriage is dead silent as you and Sabastian sit in silence, contemplating everything.
Narrator: You clear your throat, finally breaking the deafening quietness.
Eve(sad): So Liam visited Dracula and his wife on the day of the murder?
Narrator: Sabastian only grumps with discontent concern.
Sabastian(angry): It appears to be the case.
Eve(sad): Well why would he be visiting Dracula? Mary?
Sabastian(angry): He wouldn't.
Narrator: Sabastian grits his teeth, clenching a fist.
Eve*Think(sad): He seems really angry about this. Should I ask him about it or just leave him be?
(iatw_11_01_sabastians_anger)
A. Ask Sabastian if Liam had an affair with Mary!
B. Stay quiet.
A
Eve(sad): You don't think... you don't think Liam is the letter writer, do you?
Eve(sad): The one called <b>"L"</b>?
Sabastian(sad): I do not know.
Sabastian(sad): For the sake of this case, my brother, and everyone involved, I certainly hope to gods not.
B
Eve*Think(sad): I'll wait. This probably isn't the right time.

Narrator: The carriage yanks to a stop, nearly sending you tumbling to the ground.

Narrator: Rushing into the mansion, you and Sabastian find the brothers gathered in the living room.
Narrator: But as you enter, you notice a tall, thin woman in a business suit.
Narrator: Collecting her briefcase, she glides past you and Sabastian as she takes her to leave.
Moira(happy): Sabastian.
Narrator: Sabastian growls under his breath.
Sabastian(angry): Moira.
Narrator: After a playful smirk that's either flirty or snarky, she takes her leave.

Eve(confuse): Who is that?
Sabastian(angry): The prosecutor for Dracula's case. Come.

Narrator: You join the other Night brothers, huddled together in discussion.
Narrator: Elijah is the first to notice you. Your presence places a beaming smile on his face.
Elijah(happy): {Eve Name}! You've returned. I'm happy to see Sabastian hasn't scared you off.
Narrator: But Sabastian ignores the quip.
Sabastian(angry): What was Van Helsing doing here?
Liam: She offered us a plea deal.
>>
Eve(surprise): Wait, the prosecutor for this case is Van Helsing? The... monster hunter?
Derek: No one better at putting away monsters, I'm afraid.
Elijah: Moira Van Helsing. She's part of the Van Helsing family. They're all monster hunters.
Liam(angry): More monsters than we are, if you ask me.

Eve*Think(Surprised): I didn't know that...
(iatw_11_02_van_helsing_family)
A. There are other members of the family?
B. Why don't you just kill them?
A
Sabastian: It's a big family. She has a brother. A very grumpy father.
B
Narrator: The brothers chuckle.
Derek(happy): We would be in jail for all of eternity. Or killed for such an action.
Elijah: They are monster hunters, but the dragons ensure their justice is fair.

Derek: If Dracula is willing to admit to the murder of his wife, Mary.
Derek: The sentence will be reduced to ten thousand years underground, rather than all of eternity.
Narrator: But the brothers brush the deal off, shaking their heads in discontent.
Eve*Think(surprise): How do I feel about that deal?
(iatw_11_03_the_deal)
A. That's not bad.
B. That's a joke.
A
Eve: I mean ten thousand years is an insane amount of time.
Eve: But at least it's not an eternity.
Eve(sad): And to be honest our case isn't that strong to begin with.
Eve(sad): Maybe Dracula should take it?
Sabastian(sad): What you're saying is true, but it doesn't matter.
B
>>
Eve(angry): Ten thousand years in a casket alone?!
Eve(angry): That would drive anyone to madness.
Eve(angry): There would be no point to even live after that.
Eve(angry): Nobody in their right mind would agree to something so insane.
>
Sabastian(angry): I agree.
***
Sabastian(angry): He'll never take that deal.
Derek: Which is why we rejected it.

Elijah(angry): No one would take it. It's a joke of a plea deal.
Liam(angry): They knew we would reject it. That can only mean their case is strong.
Liam(angry): They want the fight in court.
Derek: And we'll give it to them.

Derek: Were you both able to find anything at Dracula's home?
Eve*Think: Sabastian and I learned a lot!

A. Yes.
B. No.
A
Eve(angry): Some information that can't leave this room.
Sabastian: Yes. 
B
Eve(angry): We didn't learn who killed Mary, unfortunately.
Eve(angry): But what we did learn only complicates things.

Sabastian: What we learned requires a conversation this instant. With everyone here.
Sabastian(angry): But especially with Liam.

Sabastian: The butler's memories were clean.
Sabastian: But {Eve Name} here was clever enough to check a stray cat in the garden.

Sabastian: Here's what we found on the day of Mary's death.
*Play Sound s_transformation2
Narrator: The memory catcher bellows smoke within, dancing into the cat's perspective in the garden.
Narrator: And the feet that step into view. The shoes Sabastian recognize as Liam's.
Sabastian(angry): If you've got an answer, now's the time.
Narrator: Liam only stares at his brothers, struggling to find the words.
Narrator: But there's nothing he can say.
Narrator: This becomes especially clear when you look down at Liam's feet.
Narrator: He's wearing the exact same shoes as in the Memory Catcher.

Narrator: Liam stiffens, then stands. You step back, afraid to get between two angry vampires.

Liam(angry): What I do is my business, not yours.
Narrator: Liam hisses his words at his brothers, like poison from his mouth.
Narrator: But the brothers only laugh mockingly at his intimidating words.
Sabastian(angry): Really? Because this sure as hell looks like it's all our business now!

Liam(angry): My business is my own, brother. We all have demons to bring up.

Eve(angry): You're clearly involved in this case on a personal level.
Eve(angry): Something you should have told us from the beginning.
Eve(angry): The only thing Sabastian is guilty of is catching you with your hand in the cookie jar.

Elijah(surprise): What? Cookie jar?
Narrator: The brothers stare at you in confusion.
Eve(angry): Ugh, it's an expression. I mean Liam was caught!

Liam(sad): Mary reached out to me. She needed help and didn't know who else to ask.
Elijah(angry): What could she have possibly needed you for?
Narrator: Liam glares at his brothers.
>>
Liam(angry): Her baby. She was worried about her pregnancy and needed a healer, so she called me.
Liam(angry): Unless you all have suddenly forgotten we're all elemental druids with the power of healing.
Narrator: This silences Liam's brothers temporarily as they soak in this new information.
Eve(Sad): ...

A. I guess that makes sense.
B. But why you?
B
Eve(Angry): But why would she ask you?
Eve(Angry): Why not any of your other brothers?
Narrator: But Liam only waves off your question, clearly avoiding it. 
***
Narrator: Liam takes advantage of the temporary moment of silence.
Liam: She was very sick and worried she wouldn't make it through the pregnancy alive.
>
Elijah(sad): Even if that were true, why go? Why risk everything for Vlad's wife?
Liam(angry): We took an oath, brothers, before the sacred groves of our ancestors.
Liam(angry): We vowed to provide healing to those in need.
Liam(angry): Arm in arm, we swore to help those in need so long as there is blood in our veins.
Liam(angry): Have you all forgotten your vows?
Narrator: Again, only silence from the siblings.
Liam(angry): The better question is... how could I refuse her?
Narrator: Seemingly convinced, it's Derek that breaks the silence.
Derek(sad): Who else knows about this?
Liam(angry): No one. We were beyond caring.
>>
Elijah(surprise): Tell me this, Liam. Why meet at her home?
Elijah(surprise): Why not somewhere else? Anywhere else? Somewhere you couldn't get caught?
Liam(sad): Dracula had her house-bound.
Liam(sad): He claimed it was for the safety of their unborn child, but he was just jealous and paranoid.
Eve(surprise): Paranoid of what?
Liam(sad): Of everything. I know he seems calm and collected when you met him.
Liam(sad): but years of loss and pain have turned the man tragically lost.
>
Liam(sad): A permanent state of pain and paranoia that his loved ones will turn on him.
Eve*Think(surprise): I didn't know that...
Eve*Think(surprise): Should I ask him about the love letters?

A. Ask Liam if he wrote the love letters. (Cost: 18 Diamond ID: plot_iatw_11_love_letter)
B. Move on.

Eve(surprise): What about the letters?
Narrator: Liam frowns.
Liam(surprise): What letters?
Narrator: You motion to Sabastian to show him what you both found.
Narrator: Sabastian pulls the letters out of the leather satchel and hands them to Liam.
Narrator: Liam studies them, before clearing his throat with a confused look.
Liam: I have no idea what these are.
Narrator: Studying his face only yields genuine confusion on his face.
Eve*Think(surprise): He seems to be honest about that...
>>
Eve(surprise): You didn't write them?
Liam: I didn't write them. Why would you think I had?
Eve(angry): Seriously? Because you were there. In secret. They were signed with an "L".
Eve(angry): Plus you're acting awfully defensive.
Liam(angry): Yes well, none of this should concern you anyway. You're human. Not even from here.
>
Eve(angry): That's where you're wrong, bucko.
Eve(angry): This is my business. I work here. I'm working on the defense team of this case.
Eve(angry):  That makes it my business whether you like it or not.
Narrator: Your anger bleeds in your words as the other brothers smile despite themselves.
Narrator: Liam only grunts in frustration at you.
B
Eve*Think(sad): Whatever. It doesn't matter.

Elijah: We need to contain this.
Elijah: If the prosecutor gets ahold of this information...
Elijah: Well... it's going to make our defense a hell of a lot more complicated.
Narrator: Sabastian nods.
Sabastian: Agreed.
Sabastian: We must consult the cartographer. See what she can tell us about these letters.
Liam: Well I sure as hell didn't write them.
Sabastian: Then we must figure out who did.
Elijah(happy): I'll go with {Eve Name}. She likes me best, after all.
Sabastian(angry): I feel since I found the letters, perhaps I should-
Narrator: But Elijah waves him off.
Elijah(happy): You've had your turn with {Eve Name}. Now it's mine.
Narrator: Sabastian frowns with his typical grumpy demeanor, finally relenting.
Derek: Before visiting the cartographer, I recommend you stop at Lilith's house.
>>
Derek: She wished to speak to us about the case. {Eve Name} should meet her.
Derek: We could use her human intuition and see if Lilith is useful for our defense.
Eve(surprise): Who's Lilith?
Sabastian: Dracula's ex-wife. And the coldest woman you will ever meet.
Elijah(happy): Very well. We will meet with her before the cartographer.
Elijah(happy): {Eve Name}, go freshen up and take a rest. I will meet you at the carriage in an hour.

Liam: But you really aren't, are you? At least not fully. You could read our ad?
Eve(angry): Yeah, that's been established.
Narrator: Liam smirks, placing his violin down.

Liam: You confound me, {Eve Name}. And I don't like being confounded.
Eve(angry): Well I don't like to be bitten against my will. I guess life is just rough sometimes, isn't it?
Liam: You are guileless.
Liam: Which makes you innocent of your own heritage. Or extremely well-trained in the art of subterfuge.

Elijah(smile): A hell of a vampire.
Elijah: She was the first of our kind, created by the Night herself.

Elijah: Dracula didn't speak of her often. They don't seem to hate each other, but they're far from friends.
Eve(confuse): Why are we meeting with her?
Elijah: The prosecutor, Van Helsing, spoke to her about the murder of his wife.
Elijah(sad): She asked her to testify in court. We need to know what she's going to say.
Elijah(sad): Van Helsing is clearly trying to smear Dracula's name.
Elijah: Hoping that she has plenty of horrible things to say about him.
