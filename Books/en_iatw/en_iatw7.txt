Eve(surprise): I can't believe that's Dracula!
Eve(surprise): I mean... the brothers told me they represent fantastical beasts.

Eve(surprise): I just didn't expect him!
Narrator: The tall, lithe man revolves around the ballroom.
Narrator: He judges every piece of furniture with his narrow gaze and smug smirk.
Eve*Think(surprise): Should I say something to him?
(iatw_07_01_greet_dracula)
A. Hello.
B. Stay quiet. 
A

Dracula(smile): Hmm.
Narrator: He doesn't even look at you, glancing around at the room.
B
Eve*Think(sad): I'm not gonna say anything!

Dracula(smile): Last time I stepped foot in this place, humans rode around in horse and buggies.
Dracula(smile): Yet not a single change in your decorations.
Dracula(smile): Shame.

(iatw_07_02_old_decorations)
A. That's not true.
B. Be quiet!
C. I agree.
A
Eve(angry): This place is nice! What kind of standards do you have where this isn't posh?!
Narrator: Finally, Dracula glances at you.
Narrator: But despite his gaze, you still feel invisible as he simply looks past you.
B
Eve(angry): You should really be more respectful.
Sabastian(angry): {Eve Name}, don't.
Eve(angry): What?! I'm just saying-
Narrator: Sabastian waves your comment away. You seal your lips shut and roll your eyes.
C
Eve(happy): This place is in desperate need of a woman's touch. I'm just happy someone finally said it.
Narrator: Dracula peers over at you, smirking at your comment. A small bow of his head confirms that he agrees.

Dracula(smile): I am, after all, quite spectacular.
Narrator: You see Sabastian and Liam roll their eyes to Dracula's comment.
Narrator: Dracula peers over at them, but they're quick to hide their real feelings with a fake smile.

Dracula(smile): My goodness. A feisty one, isn't she?

Eve(happy): I can honestly say I never thought I'd meet Dracula in the flesh.
Dracula(happy): Now that you have, what do you think?
Eve(happy): Eh, I've seen better.
Dracula(happy): Now my dear, I'm not sure if I buy that.
Eve(happy): Well, you don't know what I've seen.
Dracula(happy): I can only imagine the chaos you will bring here at the Night Firm, young one.
Dracula(happy): I fear you may throw this law firm into chaos.
Eve(happy): Well we could all use a little crazy in our life, can't we?
Eve(happy): After all, it sounds like you have plenty.
Dracula: That I do. And you, {Eve Name}, may be too much for me.
Dracula(happy): Something I never thought I'd say to a human.
Dracula(happy): You truly are special, aren't you, young one.
Eve(happy): Suppose you'll have to wait and find out.
Dracula(happy): I suppose I will.

Narrator: Dracula paces around the room.
Dracula(smile): Your birth father slept with your mother.
Dracula(smile): I gave you immortality and power beyond measure.

Narrator: The brothers don't have an answer to that. Derek clears his throat shifting in his seat.
Derek(happy): Well... we've been reading up on your case.
Derek(smile): Obviously, we have agreed to represent you in court pro bono.

Eve(surprise): You're doing this free of charge? Why?
Derek(angry): Because we have made an agreement.
Elijah: He is the one that turned us into vampires. We owe him a debt.

Eve(confuse): Is that how it works? If you turn someone, you can control them?
Derek: Not entirely, but close. It's a compulsion that's near impossible to resist.
Sabastian: And if you resist too long, it can cause serious pain.
Sabastian: But it takes energy from both parties, so it's not used as often as you might imagine.

Eve: But he's using it now? For this?

Derek(happy): Our legal system works quickly in this world.
Derek: And the prosecutors are really gunning for Dracula.

Eve: What if he's guilty?
Derek: He says he's not.
Eve: But... what if he is.
Narrator: Liam glares at you.

Liam(angry): We don't have a choice.

Derek: Elijah, why don't you take {Eve Name} to the library to begin studying. Find her the right books.

A. Yes.
B. No.
C. I don't know.
A
Eve(angry): She was drained of blood. Who else would do that besides Dracula?
Eve(angry): And take it from me. The most dangerous person to a wife is her husband.
Eve(angry): More husbands kill wives than anybody else. Makes sense to me.

Lily(happy): Oh! I'll find him a food and water bowl. And kitty litter! I think we have some!
Eve(smile): Good idea. Want to take him?
Narrator: Lily leaps for the cat, her widening smile clearly a yes to your question.
Narrator: She turns and leaves, returning into the house.
Lily(happy): Come on, boy! Let's see your new home!
Narrator: You watch Lily leave, laughing.
B
Eve*Think(sad): I probably don't have the time to take care of a cat. I should be smart about this!
Eve*Think(sad): As much as I'd love one, I can barely take care of myself.
Eve*Think(sad): This cat deserves more love than I can give.
Narrator: Setting the cat down, you try your best to shoo it away.
>>
Eve(sad): Shoo! Get out of here! Find another home.
*Play Sound s_cat
Kitten(sad): *meow*?
Narrator: The kitten lingers, refusing to leave. After one final shove, the kitten scurries off.
Narrator: But instead of returning to the bushes, it sprints off towards the backdoor.
*Camera Left 0.5
Narrator: Just at that second, the door swings open as Lily steps outside.
Lily(surprise): {*Attention Ahh!}
Narrator: She jumps, startled by the kitten.
Narrator: After a high-pitched squeal of delight, she wraps her hand in the tiny creature.
Lily*Shout(happy): Oh my Goodness! A cat!
Narrator: You walk over to Lily.
Eve(sad): Yeah I just found him here.
>
Lily(happy): He's so cute! Please tell me you're keeping him.
Eve(sad): I can't. I just don't have the time to show a pet the love it deserves.
Lily(sad): That's understandable. But I do!
Lily(happy): A pet is exactly what we need. Too much testosterone with all the Night Brothers.
Lily(happy): I'll take care of him, don't worry.
Eve(happy): Okay, fair enough.
>>
Lily(happy): I heard you were out here. I hadn't seen you since the crash. Are you doing okay?
Eve(happy): I'm hanging in there. I'm definitely getting a crash course of this world.
Lily(happy): It's definitely a lot to take in. But I'm happy you're here.
Lily(happy): And I'm happy this little guy showed up!
Narrator: Lily nuzzles into the cat.
Lily(happy): Oh! I'll find him a food and water bowl. And kitty litter! I think we have some!
>
Narrator: She turns and leaves, returning into the house.
Lily(happy): Come on, boy! Let's see your new home!
Narrator: You watch Lily leave, laughing.

Eve*Think(surprise): With all this craziness lately, I didn't realize I had stayed up all night.

Eve*Think(sad): I guess I better get used to that, working for vampires now...
Narrator: Turning around, you head back into the mansion.
Eve*Think(happy): I should really try to get some sleep!

Narrator: Your eyes slowly open as you roll over on your new, king-sized mattress.
Narrator: The silk sheets gently caress your skin, coaxing you to return to your slumber.
Eve*Think(happy): I've never slept on a bed so comfortable.
Eve*Think(happy): That was some of the best sleep I've ever had. I didn't even know I was tired.
Narrator: You check the time.

Eve*Think(surprise): 6PM. I slept through the whole day!
Eve*Think(sad): I guess that's my new life. Sleeping all day, working all night.
Narrator: Stretching, you slowly step out of bed and approach your wardrobe.
Eve*Think(happy): Alright. Second day on the job. Hopefully it'll be smoother than the first.
Narrator: You take a sniff of yourself.

Narrator: Your bed is made. The wardrobe, organized.
Narrator: Your previous clothes were tossed on the floor, but now they're gone.
Eve*Think(angry): Was someone in my room?!
Eve(surprise): Hello!?
Narrator: Only silence replies, an eerie calm falling over your room.
Eve*Think(surprise): Who was in here while I showered!?
