*Scene QUEEN_CHANGINGROOM (Color: Black) 
Narrator: You've snuck out of the Masquerade party, and at the moment you're in a changing room having a secret rendezvous with the Queen... 
Narrator: Who has just dropped a bombshell on you. 
>>>
Therese: I want you to impersonate Marie and infiltrate the party!
>>
Alice(surprise): You want me to do <i>what??</i>
A. But we look nothing alike!
B. But what if someone suspects I'm not her?
C. This is so exciting!
A
Therese: That's why this Masquerade is the perfect opportunity. 
Therese: With her dress and her mask, and Agnes doing your hair to look like hers... 
Therese: Nobody will guess that you're not her.
B
Therese: Then you will excuse yourself and leave immediately, before that person can do anything.
Therese: They can suspect all they want, but that's all they'll be able to do.
Therese(smile): But don't worry dear, I'm confident that no one will suspect anything.
C
Therese: Yes, but don't forget it's also dangerous, so you have to be extremely careful.
Alice: Yes, of course.

Alice(surprise): How did you manage to get hold of Marie's dress and mask?
Therese(smile): I arranged for a sleeping draught to be slipped into her drink earlier in the evening. 
Alice(surprise): You did <i>not.</i>
Therese(smile): Even as we speak, Marie is sleeping it off in her chamber. 
Narrator: You both stare at each other, until you can't hold it in and start giggling.
Narrator: The queen is smiling too, and then the both of you are giggling like crazy.
Narrator: You wipe away tears from laughing too hard.
Alice(smile): Sorry, the mental image was just too funny.
Therese(smile): No need to apologize, it really is very funny.
Alice: Okay, so what should I do when I'm back in the ballroom as Marie?
Alice: Is there anyone in particular that I should speak with?
Therese: Yes. I think you would find out the most information by speaking with the person I suspect the most.
Alice(sad): You mean...
>>>
Therese: Yes. Rene Mazarin.
>>
Narrator: You break out in a cold sweat even upon hearing his name.
Alice(sad): Your Majesty...
A. I don't think I can do it.
B. Do I really have to speak with him?
C. I'm scared, but I'll try my best.
A
Therese: I understand why you'd feel that. And I'll never force you to do something you don't want to do.
Therese: But just know that if you decide to do it, I'll be right there in the ballroom watching over you.
B
Therese: No, you definitely don't have to do anything that you don't want to.
Therese: But just know that if you decide to do it, I'll be right there in the ballroom watching over you.
C
Narrator: The Queen throws her arms around you.
Therese: You're so brave and strong.
Therese: And I want you to know that I'll be right there in the ballroom watching over you.

Therese: And I'll never let him hurt you.
Alice(sad): ...
Alice: Okay, I feel better knowing that.
Therese(smile): Okay, I have to get back before Louis and other people start wondering where I am.

Therese(smile): I'll leave you to get dressed and ready. 
Alice(smile): Yes, your Majesty.
Narrator: The queen leaves the room and Agnes helps you to change into Marie's gown, and you put on her mask.
*Alice Outfit Marie_Masquerade
Alice(surprise): Wow. I'm already looking a lot like her.
Agnes: Just wait till I do your hair, milady. Nobody will be able to tell you're not her.
Narrator: You sit down and let the queen's handmaid transform your hair into Marie's...
// Need a code to record Alice's hairstyle before changing it to Marie's hairstyle.
*Alice Hair Marie_Hair
Narrator: And the transformation is complete.
Alice*Think: Wow... the queen was right. 
Alice*Think: With Marie's dress and mask on, it's almost impossible to tell that I'm not her.
Alice: Thank you for your help, Agnes. 
Agnes: My pleasure, milady!
Agnes: I'll be staying here, to help you to change back into your own gown afterwards.
Alice: Okay!

Narrator: You head back to the ballroom, feeling slightly anxious...
Narrator: But it turns out that you had nothing to worry about.
Anne: There you are, Marie! I was looking all over for you. Where did you go?
>>
Alice: I...
A. I had to go powder my nose.
B. I was looking for Philippe.
C. Why were you looking for me?
A
Anne: For so long?
Narrator: You put on Marie's usual impatient expression.
Alice: Why, is there something important?
Anne: Oh, nothing. Just that our father was looking for you.
B
Anne: Maybe he's hiding from you.
Narrator: You put on Marie's usual impatient expression.
Alice: Ha ha. Why, is there something important?
Anne: Oh, nothing. Just that our father was looking for you.
C
Anne: Oh, it was actually our father who was looking for you.
***

Alice: Oh, okay.
Narrator: You immediately feel a stab of anxiety in your chest, but manage to keep your face blank.
Marie: Did he say why he wanted to speak with me?
Anne(sad): No, but he didn't seem to be in a good mood though.
Narrator: The feeling of anxiety gets worse, making your mouth go dry and your heartbeat pick up.
Alice: Where is he?
Anne: Last I saw him he was somewhere over on the other side of the room.
Alice: Okay I'll go look for him. Thanks Anne.
Anne: Huh? Are you feeling okay?
Alice: Yeah, why?
Anne: Just that... you just thanked me...
Alice*Think(sad): Oh... I have to remember that Marie is more rude! 
Alice*Think(sad): If I'm too polite people will get suspicious!
Alice: Yeah well...
A. Don't get used to it.
B. Are you done talking?
C. Gasp! Are you saying I'm usually very rude?
A
Anne: Ah, see. That's more like you.
B
Anne: Ah, see. That's more like you.
C
Anne: Well, I mean, you usually are...

Narrator: You slowly make your way to the other side of the ballroom.
Narrator: You see the Queen sitting beside the King, in conversation with him...
Narrator: And Rene Mazarin standing against the wall on the far side, just as Anne said he would be.
*Rene Outfit Rene_Mask
Rene(angry): ...
Narrator: His entire posture is stiff and tense, and you realize that...
Alice*Think(surprise): He really does seem to be in a bad mood.
Alice*Think(sad): Oh my god... I have to go up to him and pretend I'm his daughter.
Alice*Think(sad): The last time I saw him, he was trying to get me condemned for witchcraft!
Narrator: You start to feel really sick with dread... 
Narrator: But you turn and catch the Queen's eyes, and she nods slightly at you, reassuring you.
Therese(smile): ...
Narrator: And you make yourself walk right up to him, even though your heart is pounding like mad in your chest.
Narrator: He turns to look at you, and for a moment, you imagine what will happen if he realizes that you're not his daughter... 
Narrator: And you break out in a cold sweat.
Rene: Hmph. There you are. I suppose your sister told you I was looking for you.
Alice*Think: Yes! He doesn't realize a thing! The plan is actually working! 
Alice: Yup. Is something the matter, Father?
>>
Narrator: Mazarin looks around him, then lowers his voice.
Rene: How are you getting along in winning Philippe's affection?
Alice*Think(surprise): Philippe?
Narrator: Quickly, you hide your surprise and put on Marie's usual haughty, bitchy demeanor.
Alice: I...
A. I have everything under control.
B. I'm working on it.
C. Why do you ask?
A
Rene: Do you really? Because it doesn't look that way to me.
B
Rene: That's obviously not good enough. 
C
Alice: Don't you trust me?
Rene: I don't think you understand the gravity of it.

Alice: What do you mean, Father?
Rene(angry): It seems to me like he still has eyes for that nobody newcomer.
Narrator: You flush slightly as you realize the <i>nobody newcomer</i> he's referring to is you.
Rene(angry): Are you listening, Marie? 
>>>
Rene(angry): You absolutely must gain control of the situation, and succeed with our plan. 
Rene(angry): Do whatever you must... including sleeping with him if you have to. 
>>
Narrator: Your mouth drops open in shock, and you struggle to regain your composure.
Alice: That's a bit... extreme, isn't it?
Rene(angry): No, it isn't. 
Rene: <i>Have</i> you slept with him yet?
Alice: I...
A. Not yet.
B. Eww, Father!
A
Rene(angry): And why not?
Alice: I... I'm working on it!
B
Alice: Stop asking me that!

Rene(angry): Well, it's important. Win him over quickly. 
Rene(angry): Otherwise all of what I've done would have been in vain!
Narrator: He stops short, as if checking himself.
Alice(surprise): <i>All of what you've done?</i> What did you do?
Rene: Never you mind.
Alice*Think: This must be what Queen Therese needs me to find out!
Alice*Think: I need to get him to talk!
A. Get him to tell you what he did! (Cost 18 Diamond)
B. Just let it slide.

*Gain RENECONFESSION
Alice: Father, I can't believe you're hiding something from me. First of all, this concerns me. 
Alice: You just told me that I should do whatever it takes, including sleeping with him!
Alice: I think we're past the point keeping things secret from each other, don't you?
Rene: You don't understand. The less you know, the more you're protected if things... don't work out as planned.
Alice: What's that? Don't tell me you're not confident of our plan?
Rene: ...
Narrator: Mazarin stares at you for a few seconds without speaking... 
Narrator: And for a moment you feel a trickle of fear at the thought that he might have seen through your disguise.
Rene: Fine, you really want to to know what I did?
Narrator: You nod wordlessly.
Narrator: He leans in closer to you, dropping his voice to a whisper.

Message: Snake In The Palace | You got Rene Mazarin to confess to poisoning the king!
Rene: <b><i>I was the one who poisoned the food.</b></i>

Alice(surprise): Oh my god! But why-
Rene: So you can become queen, you stupid girl, why do you think?
Alice(surprise): But why-
Rene: Are you really that slow? And then we just have to get rid of Philippe, then we'll be in <b><i>complete control.</b></i>
Alice: I see.
Rene: Now do you see what's at stake here?
Alice: You didn't succeed though. Louis is recovering.
Narrator: Mazarin chuckles, a dark and foreboding sound that sends chills down your spine.
Rene: Who's to say he won't <i>suddenly take a turn for the worse?</i>
Alice(surprise): Do you mean you're going to <b><i>try again?</b></i>
Rene: That's none of your business. 
Rene: Just do your part and make sure Philippe marries you.
Alice: But we're already engaged to be married, so why are you so worried?
Rene(angry): Because engagements can be <i>called off</i>, you stupid girl! 
Rene(angry): So if you want to be Queen, you'd better make sure you win over Philippe!
Narrator: And with that, Mazarin storms off, leaving you standing there with this enormous revelation.
Message: Mission Accomplished | Congratulations, you succeeded in your spying mission!
Alice*Think: I can't believe it, I actually managed to find out what happened!
Alice*Think: And not only that, I even found out that Mazarin is planning to finish off what he started!
Alice*Think: I need to tell the Queen what I've discovered immediately!
B
Alice*Think: I'd better not push him if he doesn't want to tell... he might get suspicious.
Rene: Anyway, just do your part and make sure Philippe marries you.
Alice: But we're already engaged to be married, so why are you so worried?
Rene(angry): Because engagements can be <i>called off</i>, you stupid girl! 
Rene(angry): So if you want to be Queen, you'd better make sure you win over Philippe!
Narrator: And with that, Mazarin storms off, leaving you standing there in shock.
Alice*Think: Wow, Mazarin is really dead set on having Marie marry Philippe.
Alice*Think: And that line he said about how <i>"otherwise all of what I've done would have been in vain".</i>
Alice*Think: As in, orchestrating the engagement of his daughter to Philippe... 
Alice*Think: Or something more sinister than that? 
Alice*Think: I'd better tell the Queen about all this!

Narrator: A sword in its scabbard is carefully placed on an oak writing table... 
Narrator: And a vest which you recognize as belonging to Philippe is draped carelessly over an armchair.
Philippe: Yes, it's my room.
Narrator: Philippe strides over to an armoire and retrieves something from it... 
Narrator: Which he places carefully on the writing table, propping it against the wall.
Alice: Oh, the painting of me.

Narrator: The two of you stand in front of his painting of you, in the moonlight. 
Narrator: The resemblance of the woman in the painting to you is just as striking now as it was when you first saw it.
Narrator: Philippe stares at it for some time without speaking, then he turns to you, removing his mask.

Philippe: {Alice Name}, I'm more certain than ever that it was you who haunted my dreams.
Philippe: Not only that, but you've been more than I could have ever dreamed of. 
Narrator: You remove your mask as well.

Alice(shy): Philippe...
Philippe: I may not know how or why this happened, but I'm glad that it did. 
Narrator: He takes a step towards you, closing the distance between the two of you.
Narrator: Gazing into your eyes, he gently strokes your cheek with the back of his hand.
Philippe: {Alice Name}... *Model

Narrator: Raising yourself on the tip of your toes, you lean forward and kiss him full on the lips!
Narrator: Philippe immediately reciprocates, cupping your face with both of his hands as he kisses you back passionately.

*Philippe Romance +1
Philippe: {Alice Name}... you drive me crazy.
Alice: Well then it's only fair, since you drive me crazy too.
Philippe(smile): In a good or bad way?
Alice(smile): I've yet to decide.
Philippe(smile): Then let me see if I can help you make up your mind.
Narrator: Philippe resumes kissing you hard, his mouth almost bruising your lips with his passion.
Narrator: You sigh and wrap your arms around his neck, relishing the taste of him.
Narrator: Once again, he has you with your back up against a wall, and you moan as he pins you against the hard wall with his even harder body.
Narrator: His lips trail along the curve of your cheekbone, the dip below your earlobe, the length of your exposed neck...
Narrator: As you close your eyes and throw your head backward in pleasure from his relentless kiss.
Alice: Mmm...

Philippe(smile): How about now? Have you decided yet?
A. Maybe...
B. Not yet... 
C. Try harder...
A
Philippe(smile): You don't sound convinced... let me see if this will convince you...
B
Alice(smile): Maybe if you keep this up though...
Philippe(smile): Mmm, with pleasure...
C
Philippe(smile): Mmm, with pleasure...

Narrator: He murmurs into your neck, sending a shiver down your spine.
Philippe: Your skin tastes delicious.
Narrator: Slowly, his mouth slides lower and lower, until he's kissing your cleavage, the heat of his lips making you gasp in pleasure.
Alice: Stop teasing me...
Narrator: You wiggle against him until his hips swing forward to trap you more firmly against his frame. 
Philippe: Who's teasing?
Narrator: Your aching, swelling bosom is flattened against his chest, and you realize you can feel the pounding of his heart... 
Narrator: Leaping and skittering with the same fevered excitement as yours.
Narrator: Your head is spinning as his right hand slowly moves down your hip, grabbing your thigh and forcing you to wrap your leg around him...
Narrator: And you feel a heat growing in your lower tummy, as he grinds himself against you.
Philippe: How about now? 
Alice: Oh Philippe, yes...

Narrator: You gently cup his hand on your cheek with your left hand, while staring up back at him.
Alice: I don't know why this happened either, but I'm glad that I'm here too.
Alice(sad): I just wish that things weren't so... complicated.
Philippe(sad): I know, me too.
Philippe: But they won't be for much longer, I promise.
Philippe: Louis is getting better, I'm going to settle this nonsense with Marie once and for all...
Philippe: We'll find out who tried to poison Louis and take care of him...
Philippe: And then we'll be free to do whatever we want.

Marie(angry): I could ask the both of you the same question!
