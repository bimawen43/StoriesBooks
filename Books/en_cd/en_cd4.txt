Message: Alone Time At Last | Because you got rid of Anne earlier on, you have now unlocked a special bonus scene!
Narrator: He turns and gazes at you, a small smile playing on his lips.
Narrator: You're suddenly very aware of your proximity to him... and exactly how attractive he is, again...
Narrator: You are mesmerized by the flecks of gold dancing in his emerald green eyes...
Narrator: He casually leans in closer to you, and brushes a stray strand of hair off your face... 
Narrator: Where his fingertips graze your cheekbone, they leave behind an electric, tingling sensation... and you blush hotly.

Armand(smile): Are you sure you want me to tell you?
Narrator: You start to feel hot all over, and you realize to your shock that you're actually having trouble breathing.
Armand(smile): Your cheeks are such a lovely shade of pink...
