Narrator: You are standing in the king's antechamber, being tried for <color=red>witchcraft</color>.
Rene: I will now present the last witness.
Narrator: A wave of shock hits you as the last witness steps into the room.
>>
Alice*Think(surprise): It's Anne!
>
Anne(sad): ...
Narrator: Anne studiously avoids looking at you as she walks up to the front of the room.
Rene: Tell everybody who you are, please.
Anne(surprise): But you all already know who I am-
Rene: It's for the official records.
Anne(sad): I'm Anne Mazarin... your daughter.
Rene: You've been witness to the accused's behavior almost ever since she first arrived, have you not?
Anne: Well I didn't see what happened when she first arrived here at the palace, or at the market...
Anne: But yeah, I was visiting Armand when he brought her back home with him.
Rene: Have you seen or heard anything... out of the ordinary about her?
Narrator: Anne glances at you, and for a brief second almost seems to look regretful... but she looks away again quickly.
Anne: Oh yeah.
>>
Alice*Think(sad): So much for all those declarations of friendship.
>
Anne(angry): First of all, she latched on to Armand as soon as she arrived, <i>bewitching</i> him.
Anne(angry): Then, as soon as she arrived at the palace the next day, she did the same to Philippe.
Rene: Explain what you mean by <i>bewitched</i>.
Anne(angry): The both of them fell for her so fast, it was ridiculous. And most certainly <i>unnatural</i>.
Anne(angry): I've no doubt she cast a spell on them.
>>
Armand(angry): This is the most ludicrous thing I've ever heard.
Philippe(angry): Seriously, Anne?
Anne(angry): I mean, look at them! They're completely under her spell!
Anne(angry): Like I said, first she cast a spell on Armand that night...
Anne(angry): Then she wrangled her way into coming along with us to the palace the very next morning...
Anne(angry): Where she immediately sank her claws into Philippe.
Anne: Oh! I almost forgot. She's no noblewoman, even though she pretends to be one.
Anne: She'd never ridden in a carriage before that morning!
Anne: And then she talked about <i>driving machines made of metal called cars</i>.
Narrator: Anne shuddered dramatically and made the sign of the cross.

Narrator: Then she lowers her voice to an exaggerated whisper.
Anne: The worst and strangest thing is... <i><b>She got Philippe to paint a portrait of her</b></i>...
Anne: Months before she came!
Rene: How do you know that?
Anne: Philippe told all of us himself.
>
B

Rene: It's interesting that you mention her putting a spell on Philippe...
Rene: Were you aware of the portrait he'd painted of her?
Anne(surprise): Huh?
Narrator: Mazarin turns to the King and Queen, and his voice raises dramatically.
Rene: You see, your Majesties...
Rene: <i><b>The accused got Philippe to paint a portrait of her... months before she came!</b></i>

Narrator: You look at the King and Queen. Louis has a look of shock on his face, and even Therese looks taken aback.
Louis(surprise): Philippe, is this true?
Narrator: Philippe steps forward quickly.
Philippe(angry): It's true that I'd painted a portrait of a woman who I'd had several dreams about...
Philippe(sad): But it's ridiculous to claim that that woman is Lady {Alice Name}, just because there's a resemblance.
Louis: I think that we should see this portrait.
Rene: Of course. I already have it here.
*Camera Left 3
Narrator: Two of the guards leave the room and come back almost immediately carrying a painting and an easel, and set it up just in front of the King.
Rene: As you can see, your Majesty, this is clearly a portrait of the accused.
Louis(surprise): This... it certainly looks like her, yes.
>>
Louis: Lady {Alice Name}, what do you have to say about this?
Alice(sad): Your Majesty...
(cd_13_02_explain_painting)
A. I knew nothing about this until that day.
B. I've never seen that portrait in my life!

Louis: What happened that day?
Alice: Philippe showed us the portrait, and we all remarked how similar the girl looked to me.
*Alice Trial +1
Alice: It's not like anybody had anything to hide. It came as a huge surprise to me too, as you can imagine.
>
Narrator: There is a silence as the King considers your words.
Therese: She has a point. You frequently dream of deer and wild boar before a hunt, Louis.
Therese: And sometimes I dream of parties and the food that will be served, before the event happens.
Therese: Perhaps the dreams are just indicative of our thoughts and desires.
Louis: Hmm...
Narrator: Mazarin narrows his eyes.
B
>
Rene: Oh really? Because the guards say that Philippe showed you this painting that day.
Rene: In addition, I retrieved this <i><b>from your room.</b></i> (Condition: PHILIPPE_PAINTING >= 1)
Alice(sad): I... I mean... I didn't know about it before then!
Rene: Your story changes when you get caught in a lie, hmm?
Alice(sad): I'm not lying! This has nothing to do with me!
Louis: Hmm...
Narrator: Mazarin smiles triumphantly, as if sensing that victory was near.

Rene: The palace is heavily guarded.

B
Alice(sad): I... I thought I was somewhere else!
Rene: Oh? Where did you think you were?
Alice(sad): I thought I was in an artefacts display room.
C
Rene: Aha! So you were trying to steal her Majesty's jewellery?
Alice(sad): No!
Therese: But I don't keep any of my jewellery in my study.
Rene: What ring were you looking at, then?
Alice(sad): An emerald ring that belongs to Armand...
Rene: In her Majesty's study?

Rene: A likely story. Are you sure you weren't there trying to get hold of her Majesty's personal effects?
Alice(surprise): {*Attention What?? No!}
Rene: It's well known that in order to cast a spell on someone.
Rene: Witches often require a personal belonging of the victim...

Narrator: The both men step forward at once.
Armand(angry): Your Majesty, frankly I find it insulting for anyone to say that Lady {Alice Name} put a spell on me.
Armand: My affections for her are easy to explain.
Armand: I wasn't, as Lady Anne claims, 'immediately bewitched' by her.
Armand: At first I was merely concerned about her safety.
Armand: I wasn't going to leave her alone and defenceless on the streets, unable to fend for herself.
Armand: That's not the way that I was brought up.
Armand: But then the more time I spent with her, the more some of her qualities became obvious to me.
Armand: She's brave, kind, and selfless.
Narrator: Armand's kind words fills you with a warm glow, and you fight to hold back tears.

Armand: So I beg Lord Mazarin not to insult me with that ridiculous claim...
Armand: That what I feel for Lady {Alice Name} is nothing but a spell.
Louis: Hmm... Thank you for your testimony, Lord Armand.
Louis: What about you, Philippe? I'd like to hear from you too.
Philippe(angry): This accusation of witchcraft and spells is ridiculous.
Louis: It's true that you're not the same person you were before.
Philippe(smile): If you mean my old habit of playing the field...
Philippe: I've been changing a long time before this, as you well know.
Therese(smile): That's true.
Philippe: Like Armand, my feelings for Lady {Alice Name} didn't happen immediately.
Philippe: At first, I was intrigued by her, because yes, firstly she resembles this person that I dreamed of.
Philippe: But mostly because unlike most of the other ladies in court, she actually dares to speak her mind.
Philippe: She's honest, and it's a refreshing change.
*Alice Trial +1

Narrator: You wake up the next morning snuggled up between Armand and Philippe, your head resting on Philippe's shoulder, Armand's arm around you.
Philippe(smile): Good morning.
Alice(smile): Good morning. Have you both been awake long?
Armand(smile): Maybe five minutes. But I was happy to wait for you to wake up.
Narrator: Armand and you share a slow, lingering kiss, then you turn and kiss Philippe slowly too.
Alice(smile): Mmm... This is a nice way to wake up.
Philippe(smile): I wouldn't mind waking up like this every morning.
Armand(smile): Jeanne should be waiting to come in and help you get dressed for breakfast.
Armand(smile): Shall we wait for you in the salon for breakfast?
Alice(smile): Oh! Yes, Jeanne will accompany me there after. 
Narrator: The both men get up and start to dress, as you enjoy the sight of their bodies.
Alice(smile): Such a pity that you have to wear clothes.

Philippe(smile): I could say the same for you. 
Armand(smile): See you in the salon.
Alice(smile): Yes, see you.
Narrator: They leave the room, and sure enough, Jeanne enters almost immediately.
Jeanne(happy): Good morning milady!
Narrator: You can see that she's bursting with curiosity, as she bustles over to help you get ready.

Alice: What is it?
Jeanne: Did his Grace and his Highness really spend the night in your room?
Narrator: Her question burst out of her before she could stop it, her face so hopeful, that it makes you smile.
Alice(smile): They did, to watch over me as I slept.
Jeanne(smile): Ahh... 
Alice(shy): They, er... watched over me very well.
Narrator: The both of you giggle.
Jeanne(smile): Oh milady, I'm glad.
Jeanne(smile): Anyway, let's get you ready for the day.

Alice: It's late and I'm exhausted...
Narrator: The men immediately take a step back.
Philippe: Yes, of course.
Armand: You should rest early.
Philippe: Have a good rest, Lady {Alice Name}.
Narrator: They both bow and leave you alone in your room, and you change into your nightgown and climb into bed.
Narrator: Exhausted from the day's events, you fall asleep almost instantly.
