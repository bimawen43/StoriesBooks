Alice: Yes. I can be an extra set of ears, and eyes...
Alice: I may see or hear something that can help to find out who did this.
Armand(sad): It will be dangerous.
Alice: I know. But this situation is dire.
Alice: And if I can help in any way to find out who the poisoner is...

Alice: His Majesty will be safe, and we can clear your name at the same time!
Alice(angry): And we won't stop until we find him!

Narrator: Philippe stands silent for a moment, gazing at the both of you, his expression unreadable...
Narrator: Suddenly, he embraces Armand tightly!
Philippe(smile): What have I done to deserve a friend like you?

*Armand Romance +1
Armand(smile): I couldn't agree more. I feel the same too.
Alice(smile): Okay you guys, don't get mushy on me now.
Narrator: Philippe raises his hands in mock surrender.
Philippe(smile): Mushy? Not me. I don't do mushy.
Philippe(smile): Armand, on the other hand...
Armand(smile): Hey!
Philippe(smile): Kidding.
Armand(smile): Actually, Philippe pretends to be this bad boy...
Armand(smile): But he's really a teddy bear on the inside.
Philippe(surprise): A <i>"teddy bear"</i>??
Armand(smile): A soft, cuddly, teddy bear.
Philippe(smile): Hey! Well, Armand lets the ladies think he's this nice gentlemen...
Philippe(smile): But apparently he has a really wild side that he keeps hidden...
Philippe(smile): According to what I've heard some ladies whispering about him.
Armand(surprise): Philippe!
Narrator: You burst out in laughter.
Alice(surprise): Philippe...

Alice(happy): Haha, stop!
Armand(smile): Alright alright, stopping.
