Narrator: You both jump as a male voice suddenly shouts in the distance...
Narrator*Top: Voice | This way! She went into the alley! 
Narrator: The woman looks quickly towards the direction of the voice...
Narrator: Then at you again, as you stare back at her pleadingly.
Fantine(surprise): Are those the police?
Fantine(surprise): How do I know you're not a criminal??
>>
Alice(sad): I promise I'm not! Please help me!
Narrator: The seconds pass excruciatingly as she stares at you...

Narrator: The woman deftly shuts the door behind you, and slams the bolt down.
Narrator: The both of you press your ears against the wooden door and listen...
Narrator: As the sound of running footsteps on the other side of the door get closer... 
Narrator: Then gradually fade away.
Narrator: You heave a sigh of relief, and the both of you straighten up.
Fantine: I think your pursuers are gone now.

Alice: Thank you, Fantine.
Alice: I'm {Alice Name}.

Narrator: Now that you are no longer in immediate danger, you look around the room curiously.
Narrator: You are in a small, but neat and tidy sitting room, in what must be Fantine's apartment.
Narrator: Fantine crosses her arms, and frowns slightly.
Fantine: Well, {Alice Name}... Would you mind filling me in on what just happened?
Fantine: Who are you and why were those people chasing you?
Fantine(sad): You didn't do something illegal, did you?
Narrator: Fantine looks at you up and down, taking in your appearance... 
Narrator: And does a double take in surprise.
Fantine(surprise): My goodness, and why are you wearing such strange clothes??
Alice*Think(sad): Not the clothes question again!
(cd_01_17_strange_clothes)
A. Are my clothes really that strange??
B. Why do people keep asking me about my clothes??
C. Where I come from, everybody dresses like this.
A
Fantine: No! They're really nice... but it's nothing like I've ever seen before.
Narrator: She reaches out her hand curiously to touch your clothes.
Fantine: What is this material?? And the style... It's nothing like I've ever seen before.
Fantine: Are you a foreigner?
Alice(sad): Yes, I am, actually.
B
Fantine: Well, maybe because you're not dressed like everyone else?
Alice(sad): Yeah, trust me, I've noticed that too.
C
Fantine: Where do you come from, then?
Alice(sad): It's hard to explain.
Fantine(surprise): 'Hard to explain'? Why are you being so mysterious?
***
Fantine: Anyway, you haven't told me what happened, yet.
Alice(sad): You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Alice(sad): I'm not quite sure what's happened, myself.
Fantine: Try me.
Narrator: You think about all that has happened... and all that you've seen.
Narrator: How everybody is dressed... how an old room suddenly looks new... 
Narrator: The servant calling the room "Her Majesty's study"...
Narrator: And you come to a dreadful conclusion.
Alice(sad): Fantine... <i>What year is it?</i>
Fantine(surprise): What year is it???
Fantine(sad): Oh Mon Dieu... Have you knocked your head or something?
Alice(sad): Please, just tell me.
Fantine(surprise): It's 1664.
Narrator: You had been bracing yourself, but her words knock the wind out of you, nonetheless.
Narrator: You sit down heavily on a nearby chair, too shocked to even reply.
Fantine: Hey, are you okay? 
Fantine: You look like you've seen a ghost.

(cd_01_18_dreaming)
A. Can you pinch me please?
B. I must be dreaming.
A
Fantine(surprise): What?? Why??
Alice: I must be dreaming. Pinch me so I can wake up.
Fantine: Umm... okay...
Narrator: Fantine reaches over, grabs the skin on your forearm between her fingers, and pinches hard!
Alice(surprise): Oww!! That hurt!!
Fantine: You asked me to pinch you.
Alice(sad): I did.
B
Alice: Yes, this is definitely a dream.
Fantine: Does this mean that I'm a dream too?
Fantine: Has my entire existence been nothing but a dream?
Alice: I'm afraid so, Fantine. It's the only possible explanation.
Fantine: ... I don't think I'm a dream.
Alice: Now I just need to wake up.
Narrator: Fantine is laughing by now.
Fantine: Do you need me to pinch you?
Alice: No, I can do that myself.
Narrator: You grab the skin on your left forearm between your right thumb and index finger, and pinch hard!
Alice(surprise): Oww!! That hurt!!
***
Alice(sad): Guess I'm not dreaming after all.
Alice*Think(sad): But... that only leaves the other possibility...
Alice(sad): Fantine, I don't know how to put this, so I'll just say it.
Alice(sad): Where I'm from, the year is 2019.
Narrator: Fantine stares at you for a few seconds incredulously... 
Narrator: Then bursts out in laughter!
Fantine: You must have really hit your head hard.
Fantine: Just sit there, I'll get you some water...
Narrator: She starts to turn away.
Alice(sad): No, Fantine, listen to me...
Narrator: You tell her everything that has happened that day... 
Narrator: About your class trip to the Royal Palace, the strange emerald ring, the white flash of light...
Narrator: Fantine listens without saying a word, her mouth gaping open in incredulity.
Fantine(surprise): That... that's not possible.
Alice(sad): You're right. It's not possible. But that's what happened.
Narrator: She sits down on the chair beside you, clearly as stunned as you feel.
Alice(sad): So... do you believe me?
Fantine(sad): As unbelievable as your story sounds... I think I do.
Narrator: The both of you sit morosely for a few minutes, not knowing what to think, or say.... 
Narrator: Before Fantine breaks the silence.
Fantine: Well... what do you intend to do now?
Alice*Think: Good question... What should I do?
(cd_01_19_intent_to_do)

Alice: Maybe if I go back to the same room, and touch the ring again...
Alice: After they've stopped looking for me, of course.
B
Message: Risk Avoider | You prefer to play it safe!
Alice: At least until the Palace Guards stop looking for me.

Alice: And now that I actually have the opportunity, I need to seize it!

Fantine: Okay well, that's all well and good...
Fantine: But I think in order to do that, you need a change of clothes.
