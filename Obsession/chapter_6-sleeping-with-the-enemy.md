Kate(angry): You!  
Amy(surprise): Is something wrong?  
Julian(smile): Yes, is something wrong?  
Kate(sad): I...

Amy(smile): Just about ten minutes ago.  
Julian(smile): We had a nice chat, didn't we?

Kate: Michael, I'd like to speak with my sister alone for a while.  
Kate: Do you mind giving us a bit of privacy?  
Narrator: You clench your fists as you wait anxiously for his reply.  
Narrator: He smiles a small cold smile that doesn't reach his eyes and shrugs.  
Julian: ... Sure. I'll wait for you outside.  
Narrator: Julian saunters out of the room, and you close the door behind him, then sit down quickly beside Amy.  
\>>  
Kate: What did he say to you?  
Amy(surprised): Huh? He introduced himself...  
Amy: Then told me he was sorry that I was sick, and that I was very brave.  
Amy: He also asked me to let him know if there was anything that he could do for me.  
Kate: Oh.

Amy(smile): I'm okay... Just a bit more tired than usual, I guess.  
Amy(smile): But it's nice to get surprise visits like this!  
Kate(sad): I wish I could come visit you everyday...  
Amy(smile): Don't be ridiculous, you visit me often enough.  
Amy(smile): You work such long hours, you need to get enough sleep too.  
Kate: How is the treatment going?  
Amy: It's okay. It makes me feel a bit nauseous after each time, but I try to take a nap immediately after.  
Amy(sad): I think I'm starting to lose my hair, though.  
Kate: Oh, no... For what it's worth, you're still the pretty one, even if you were to go completely bald.  
Amy(smile): Haha! You're so silly, {Kate Name}. But thanks for trying to cheer me up.  
Kate: Alright well, I'm going to go now.  
Amy(smile): Go! Go! I'm fine. I think I'm going to go to sleep early.
