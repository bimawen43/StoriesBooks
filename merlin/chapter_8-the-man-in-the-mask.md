Teague(sad): I'm afraid you won't be able to see her.  
Merlin(sad): Why not?  
Teague(angry): She is the right hand of the Kingdom of Saxon. We're not worthy of an audience with her.  
Merlin(surprise): The right hand of the King?

Merlin(surprise): Magic potions? Are they really poisonous?  
Teague(angry): King Uther is afraid of magic, and this is just an excuse for him to eliminate all who practice it.  
Teague(angry): The Druids has proved that magic is powerful enough to be a threat to the Saxons.  
Merlin(angry): But the Druids wouldn't start a war, would they?
