Merlin(sad): I had a dream... Maybe it was a vision?  
Merlin(sad): It felt so real, like I was actually there... Like I was someone else, living out their life.  
Lancelot: Hmm. What was the dream about?  
Narrator: You carefully recount everything that happened.  
Merlin(sad): Thousands lay dead around me... I did everything I could, but it was not enough.  
Narrator: The strong emotions of the dream pierce through you, and you rub your aching temples.  
Merlin(sad): I tried to win using magic. I called on the Goddess of the Oak, but...

Merlin(sad): Yes... Do you recognize the name?  
Narrator: Lancelot gazes into the trees in thought.  
Lancelot: If I remember correctly, that was the goddess the Druids served.  
Merlin(surprise): The Druids?  
Lancelot: The druids were an ancient tribe that flourished for generations, back into antiquity.  
Lancelot: Whenever plagues were rampant or during great floods...  
Lancelot: The High Priestess of the Druids would appear to help people weather the crisis.  
Lancelot: Twenty years ago...  
Lancelot: Because the Saxon King feared the Druids' mysterious power, he crusaded against them...  
Lancelot: ...and brutally massacred them.  
Lancelot: There was a war...

Merlin(sad): Everything seemed real to me... But unfortunately the dream was cut short.  
Merlin(sad): I want to know what actually happened after the war was over.  
Lancelot: When I was a child, I heard a legend.  
Lancelot: It said there is a big oak tree growing at the site of this battlefield, not far away from here.  
Lancelot: And there is an old woman living in that oak.  
Lancelot: Every rainy night, people report hearing her voice, weeping for those who died...  
Merlin(surprise): ...Woah...  
Lancelot: Young children often dare each other to touch the old oak tree.  
Lancelot: Anyone touches the tree will wake up in the night and see an old woman sitting at the bedside.  
Lancelot: She will keep talking about the ancient stories.  
Lancelot: But in the morning, she will erase all the memories.

Teague(angry): Who are you?!  
Teague(angry): Well?

Narrator: He carries himself with a majestic and severe temperament, and his face is painted in mysterious lines.  
Merlin(surprise): I...  
Narrator: The man suddenly spots your necklace and clutches the pendant tightly.  
Teague(surprise): Where did you find this necklace?  
Merlin(sad): My necklace...?  
# (mm_03n_12_the_necklace)  
## A. Do I know you?  
## B. It was given to me by my mother.  
#### A  
Teague(angry): I asked you a question first. Where did you get this necklace from?!  
Narrator: The man tries to take your necklace as he speaks, but you grab it and hold on to it tightly.  
Merlin(angry): What are you doing? Stop! It's mine!  
Narrator: You break free from the man and run away, but he doesn't let you go..  
Teague(angry): Impossible! This is the necklace of the High Priestess.  
Merlin*Think(surprise): High Priestess? That woman from my dream?  
Merlin(sad): It truly is mine. It was a present given to me by my mother.  
Narrator: The man backs you into a corner. He slowly reaches out and takes the pendant, still around your neck, and holds it in his palm.  
#### B  
Teague(angry): Liar, this is clearly the necklace of the High Priestess.  
Merlin*Think(surprise): High Priestess? That woman from my dream?  
Merlin(sad): I'm not lying! It was given to me by my mother as a birthday present.  
Narrator: The man backs you into a corner. He slowly reaches out and takes the pendant, still around your neck, holding it in his palm.  
\***  
Teague(sad): Impossible...  
Narrator: The man takes a close look at you and shakes his head.  
Teague: Follow me!  
Narrator: He grabs your arm and drags you before a stone platform with a palm-shaped depression in it.  
\>>  
Teague: Place your hand there.  
Narrator: The palm print on the stone seems to have been smoothed out by many hands over the passage of time...  
Merlin*Think(surprise): I should...  
# (mm_03n_13_palm_print)  
## A. Do as he says.  
## B. Ask more questions.  
#### A  
Narrator: You stretch out your hand and rest it in the indentation.  
#### B  
Merlin(surprise): But what is it?! And what was with that tree?  
Teague: I'll explain everything in a moment. But first, your hand!  
Merlin(angry): No! It's been one weird thing after another today and I...  
Narrator: Frustrated, the man grabs your hand and pushes it down onto the stone platform.  
\***  
\>>>  
Merlin(surprise): Oh!  
Narrator: Just as your hand touches the cool stone, your necklace emits a flash of light.  
\>>  
Merlin*Think(surprise): Just like before...  
Teague(surprise): {*Shake Impossible... Impossible! You...}  
Narrator: The man stares at you, his eyes wide.  
Teague(happy): I never thought I would see this day...  
Narrator: The stone cleaves open in half. A stone basin emerges.

Teague(smile): Go on, and meet your destiny.  
Merlin: My destiny?  
# (mm_03n_14_my_destiny)  
## A. You must be mad.  
## B. What's so special about me?  
#### A  
Narrator: The man gives you a tight smile.  
Teague: You saw the flash of light when you touched the stone. You felt it.  
Merlin(sad): ...  
Teague: If I'm mad, then so are you.  
#### B  
Teague(smile): You saw the flash of light when you touched the stone.  
Teague: That hasn't happened in years. Decades, even.  
Merlin(sad): ...  
\***  
Narrator: You walk to the side of the suspended stone basin. When you come near, the water in the basin ripples as if expecting you.  
Merlin*Think(surprise): I should...  
# (mm_03n_15_water_in_the_basin)  
## A. Touch the water.  
## B. Watch closely.  
#### A  
Narrator: You reach out and dip your hand into the basin...  
Narrator: The ripples intensify, the surface of the water trembling at your touch.  
Merlin(surprise): ...!  
Teague: Don't be nervous. Let the spirit flow through you.  
Teague: With it, you can communicate with the fragments of the High Priestesses soul.  
Merlin(surprise): Spirit? What do you mean by ‘the fragments of her soul?'  
#### B  
Narrator: You bow your head, peering into the basin. The water ripples ferociously, splashing up as if to reach you.  
Merlin(surprise): ...!  
Narrator: The rippling water splashes violently until it reaches you. The moment the water makes contact, a strange feeling spreads throughout your body.  
Teague: Do not be afraid. Embrace the waters.  
Narrator: You hesitate, but allow your hand to sink into the basin.  
Teague: Through this psychic connection, you can communicate with the High Priestess's soul.  
Merlin(surprise): Are you saying I can speak to the High Priestess?  
Teague: To be more specific, you will be able to speak with the memory of the High Priestess.  
Narrator: You feel the vibration of the stone basin, and cannot pull your gaze away.  
\***

Narrator: A mist gathers on the surface of the water, falling over the sides of the basin and filling the hall.

Narrator: The High Priestess reaches for the man.

Teague(sad): Lilith! Twenty years and you haven't changed a bit... While here I stand, an old man.  
Lilith(smile): Thank you for guarding this sacred place for so long.  
Lilith(smile): I knew that you would always be the most loyal of the Druids.  
Teague(sad): ...My loyalty is to you, High Priestess. I served the Druids for a chance to see you again.  
Lilith(sad): Teague...  
Teague(smile): And here you are... At last!  
Narrator: Lilith's soft expression wavers, tears glistening in her eyes.  
Lilith(sad): How can you be so happy to see me... When it was my fault...  
Teague(sad): High Priestess... No...  
Lilith(cry): It was I who didn't recognize who King Uther really was and led the Druids to destruction.  
Lilith(cry): If I had acted...

Merlin(sad): There was nothing you could have done.  
Narrator: The High Priestess stares at you, stunned, and then a warm glow of pride fills her expression.  
Lilith(smile): {Merlin Name}, you've finally come....  
Lilith: The home of the Druids has been reduced to ashes...  
Lilith: ...but the sun's flame has not yet been extinguished.  
Merlin*Think(surprise): What is she talking about...?  
Lilith: May you carry on the will of the Goddess of the Oak and help spread the faith of freedom.  
Merlin(surprise): I'm sorry... Who are you? How do you know me?  
Lilith(sad): I am...  
Narrator: The High Priestesses voice cracks in sadness.  
Lilith(sad): I am the one you are closest to, and who you trust the most.  
Merlin(surprise): I'm sorry...

Narrator: She looks as though she's about to cry.  
Lilith(sad): We share an unbreakable bond. One day, I hope you will understand...  
Lilith(sad): My child, you are the last hope of the Druids.  
Merlin(surprise): Druids? You mean... From the war?  
Lilith(smile): You are very clever, {Merlin Name}.  
Teague(sad): Our people have lived in Camelot for generations...  
Teague(sad): Long before Southern invaders ever reached this land.  
Teague(sad): But eighteen years ago, that changed.  
Teague(sad): Barbarians invaded the Kingdom of Saxony, and the Saxon people lost.  
Teague(sad): In order to resist the foreign enemy, King Uther and the Druids joined forces.  
Teague(sad): With the help of our magical powers, the barbarians were finally defeated.  
Lilith(angry): And yet upon the first taste of victory, he turned against us.  
Lilith(angry): Magic was no longer a useful tool to King Uther. It was "witchcraft," a threat.  
Lilith(sad): Countless innocent Druids were slaughtered, all because of the Saxon King's fear of magic.  
Lilith(sad): Anyone that had the power to threaten his rule  has been killed!  
Merlin(angry): ...  
# (mm_03n_18_outcome_of_the_war)  
## A. Noblemen are all the same.  
## B. So what happened to the Druids after that?  
#### A  
Merlin(angry): They destroy anyone who dares stand up against them.  
#### B  
Teague(sad):  After our defeat in the final battle, the Druids were scattered, and forced to live in hiding.  
\***  
Merlin(sad): But what does any of that have to do with me?  
Lilith(sad): You, {Merlin Name}... You are also a member of the Druids.  
Lilith(sad): And you will bear the hope of the Druid resurrection.  
Merlin(sad): But... why me? I can't use magic, and I don't have any powers...  
Lilith(smile): The Goddess of the Oak shall protect you.  
Merlin(surprise): The Goddess of the Oak?  
Lilith(smile): The patron goddess of the Druids, a goddess of growth and hope.  
Narrator: The High Priestess waves her staff, and a soft light spreads throughout the chamber.  
Narrator: The dust vanishes. The withered candles burst into flames. All around you, the ruined hall is suddenly restored to pristine beauty.
